## Risks & Dependencies

### High-Risk Areas

1. **API Endpoints May Not Exist**
   - Risk: Frontend code references APIs that aren't built
   - Impact: Features completely non-functional
   - Mitigation: API verification must be first task

2. **No Tests = Unknown Bugs**
   - Risk: Features may have silent failures
   - Impact: Production incidents, user frustration
   - Mitigation: Write tests before marking features complete

3. **Service Listing Scope Unknown**
   - Risk: Could be 50-100+ hours if complex
   - Impact: Delays production launch
   - Mitigation: Implement MVP only

### Dependencies

- **Onboarding ‚Üí Professional Info Templates**
  - Onboarding may populate professional info
  - Must ensure data flow works

- **Professional Info ‚Üí Service Listings**
  - Listings use templates as starting point
  - Template changes may affect listings

- **Profile ‚Üí All Features**
  - User profile data used throughout
  - Profile bugs affect everything

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Complete Everything (12 weeks, 161 hours)
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks full-time
**Pros:** All features complete
**Cons:** Delays production, high risk

### Option 2: Complete Critical Features + Service Listing MVP (7 weeks, 105 hours) ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**Cons:** Service listing limited initially

### Option 3: Critical Features Only, Defer Service Listing (5 weeks, 55 hours)
**Timeline:** 1-1.5 weeks full-time
**Focus:** Profile + Professional Info + Onboarding
**Pros:** Fastest to production
**Cons:** No service listing (major missing feature)
