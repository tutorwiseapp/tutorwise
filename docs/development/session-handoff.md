## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Context Restoration

Copy and paste this message into the other session:

```
I'm continuing work on TutorWise from another session. Major changes were made:

1. **CAS (Contextual Autonomous System)** evolved:
   - Now a standalone system tool (global `cas` command)
   - Installed at: ~/.local/bin/cas
   - Project-agnostic (works with any project, not just TutorWise)
   - Auto-start capability via `cas autostart on`

2. **File Reorganization:**
   - Scripts reorganized into tools/scripts/{deployment,database,monitoring,setup,security}
   - Documentation moved to tools/docs/{setup,usage}
   - Service registry updated with new paths

3. **New Documentation:**
   - CAS Roadmap: tools/docs/CAS-roadmap.md
   - CAS Implementation Tracker: tools/docs/CAS-IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.md
   - CAS Autonomous Agent: tools/cas/agent/README.md

4. **Key Changes:**
   - cas-startup.sh moved to: tools/scripts/setup/cas-startup.sh
   - All npm scripts still work (npm run cas-startup:*)
   - New system commands: cas start, cas stop, cas status, cas health
   - Both approaches work (npm vs cas command)

5. **Services Running:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000
   - Redis: Port 6379
   - Neo4j: Port 7687

Please read these key files to restore full context:
- tools/docs/CAS-roadmap.md
- .cas-config (project registration)
- tools/configs/service-registry.json (updated paths)
```

```
Major changes in parallel session:

1. CAS evolved to standalone system tool
   - Command: `cas` (global, works anywhere)
   - Location: ~/.local/bin/cas
   - Config: ~/.config/cas/projects.json

2. File reorganization:
   - tools/scripts/ now categorized
   - tools/docs/ has all documentation
   - All paths updated in service-registry.json

3. Both work:
   - Old: npm run cas-startup:status
   - New: cas status

4. Services running:
   - Frontend: localhost:3000
   - Backend: localhost:8000
   - Databases: Redis + Neo4j

Continue with your current task. File paths may have changed.
Check tools/REORGANIZATION-SUMMARY.md if you get path errors.
```

**Full Version (Complex Work):**
```
ðŸ”„ SESSION CONTEXT RESTORE

A parallel Claude session made significant infrastructure changes.
Here's what changed:

## 1. CAS System Evolution

CAS transformed from TutorWise-specific tool â†’ Universal system manager

**What it is now:**
- Standalone CLI tool (like docker, git, npm)
- Works with ANY project (not just TutorWise)
- Multi-project support via registry
- Autonomous agent framework (in development)

**How to use it:**
```bash
cas status          # Check services
cas start           # Start all services
cas stop            # Stop all services
cas health          # Health check
cas install         # Register new project
cas list            # Show all projects
```

**Location:** ~/.local/bin/cas
**Config:** ~/.config/cas/projects.json
**Project Config:** .cas-config (in project root)

## 2. File Reorganization

**Old Structure:**
```
tools/scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ cas-startup.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ railway-deploy.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel-deploy.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ health-check.sh
â””â”€â”€ (50+ scripts mixed together)
```

**New Structure:**
```
tools/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment/      # railway-deploy.sh, vercel-deploy.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/        # neo4j, redis scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/      # health-check.sh, project-audit.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setup/          # cas-startup.sh, setup-aliases.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security/        # secret management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ testing/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utilities/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setup/          # Setup guides
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ usage/          # Usage guides
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service-registry.json  # Updated with new paths
â””â”€â”€ cas/
    â””â”€â”€ agent/          # Autonomous agent system
```

## 3. Updated References

All these were updated automatically:
- âœ… package.json (npm scripts point to new paths)
- âœ… service-registry.json (service files updated)
- âœ… QUICK-START.md (documentation links)
- âœ… cas-startup.sh (PROJECT_ROOT calculation fixed)

## 4. Backward Compatibility

**Old commands still work:**
```bash
npm run cas-startup:status
npm run cas-startup:start-all
npm run cas-startup:stop-all
```

**New commands also work:**
```bash
cas status
cas start
cas stop
```

Both use the same underlying scripts - just different interfaces.

## 5. New Documentation

**CAS Roadmap** (tools/docs/CAS-roadmap.md)
- Product vision & strategy
- Evolution: Tool â†’ Autonomous Manager â†’ Independent Platform
- Timeline: 2025-2030
- Business model & revenue projections
- Go-to-market strategy

**Implementation Tracker** (tools/docs/CAS-IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.md)
- Maps TutorWise features â†’ CAS enhancements
- Autonomy progression tracking (30% â†’ 95%)
- Feature-by-feature planning

**Autonomous Agent** (tools/cas/agent/README.md)
- AI-powered overnight development
- Jira integration for task pulling
- GitHub automation (in progress)
- Morning report generation

## 6. Services Status

Current running services:
- âœ… Frontend (Next.js): http://localhost:3000
- âœ… Backend (FastAPI): http://localhost:8000
- âœ… Redis Cache: Port 6379
- âœ… Neo4j Database: Port 7687

## 7. Key Files Changed

If you're working on these, be aware:
- tools/scripts/setup/cas-startup.sh (moved + fixed)
- tools/configs/service-registry.json (paths updated)
- package.json (script paths updated)
- .cas-config (new file - project registration)

## 8. What to Do

**If you get path errors:**
1. Check tools/REORGANIZATION-SUMMARY.md
2. Look in appropriate subfolder (deployment, database, etc.)
3. Update any hardcoded paths

**If services aren't responding:**
1. Run: cas status (or npm run cas-startup:status)
2. Restart if needed: cas restart
3. Check: cas health

**If you need context on CAS:**
1. Read: tools/docs/CAS-roadmap.md (high-level vision)
2. Read: tools/cas/agent/README.md (autonomous agent)

## 9. Safe to Continue

âœ… All tests passing
âœ… All services running
âœ… No breaking changes to TutorWise code
âœ… File reorganization complete
âœ… References updated

**You can safely continue your current task.**

If you encounter any path issues, just ask where the file moved to.

## ðŸŽ¯ Context by Task Type

### If other session is working on **Frontend:**
```
Context update: CAS infrastructure reorganized, but frontend code unchanged.
Services still running at localhost:3000 and localhost:8000.
Continue with your frontend work - nothing affects you.
```

### If other session is working on **Backend:**
```
Context update: File reorganization happened.
Backend scripts now in tools/scripts/deployment/
Health checks in tools/scripts/monitoring/
Code unchanged. Services running normally.
```

### If other session is working on **Scripts/DevOps:**
```
IMPORTANT: Major file reorganization!

Scripts moved to categorized folders:
- deployment/ (railway, vercel)
- database/ (neo4j, redis)
- monitoring/ (health, audit)
- setup/ (cas-startup, aliases)

Check tools/REORGANIZATION-SUMMARY.md for file mappings.
Update any hardcoded paths you're working on.
```

### If other session is working on **CAS itself:**
```
CRITICAL CONTEXT UPDATE:

CAS evolved significantly:
1. Now standalone system tool (global command)
2. Multi-project support added
3. Autonomous agent framework started
4. Roadmap created (2025-2030 vision)

Read these immediately:
- tools/docs/CAS-roadmap.md
- tools/cas/agent/README.md
- .cas-config

Current autonomy: 30% â†’ targeting 95% by 2026
Platform launch planned for 2026 as independent SaaS product.
```

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist for Context Restoration

Share this checklist in the other session:

- [ ] Acknowledged CAS is now a system tool
- [ ] Aware of file reorganization
- [ ] Know both npm + cas commands work
- [ ] Checked current service status
- [ ] Read relevant documentation (if needed)
- [ ] Updated any hardcoded file paths
- [ ] Ready to continue work

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If they say "file not found":**
```
The file moved. Check tools/REORGANIZATION-SUMMARY.md for mappings.
Common moves:
- cas-startup.sh â†’ tools/scripts/setup/
- railway-deploy.sh â†’ tools/scripts/deployment/
- health-check.sh â†’ tools/scripts/monitoring/
```

**If they say "command not found: cas":**
```
The `cas` command is new. Use the old npm commands instead:
- npm run cas-startup:status
- npm run cas-startup:start-all

Or add to PATH: export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**If they're confused about CAS:**
```
CAS is evolving from TutorWise tool â†’ independent platform.
For your current work, just know:
- `cas` command = system-wide service manager
- Works like `docker` or `git` (from anywhere)
- Both old (npm) and new (cas) commands work

Continue with your task - the infrastructure changes
don't affect TutorWise application code.
```
