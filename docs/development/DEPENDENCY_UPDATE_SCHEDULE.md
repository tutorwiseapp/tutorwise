# Dependency Update Schedule

To ensure that this project stays up-to-date with the latest security patches and features, we will follow a weekly dependency update schedule.

## Schedule

*   **When:** Every Monday
*   **Who:** The on-call developer for the week is responsible for the update.

## Process

1.  **Check for outdated dependencies:**
    *   Run `npm outdated` in the root directory and in each workspace to identify outdated dependencies.

2.  **Create a new branch:**
    *   Create a new branch for the dependency updates (e.g., `feat/dependency-updates-YYYY-MM-DD`).

3.  **Update dependencies:**
    *   Update the patch and minor versions of the dependencies first.
    *   Update major versions of dependencies one by one, as they may contain breaking changes.
    *   Use the `npm install <package-name>@<version>` command to update each package.

4.  **Run tests:**
    *   After each update, run the project's tests to ensure that the changes haven't introduced any regressions.
    *   Run `npm test` in the root directory and in each workspace.

5.  **Create a pull request:**
    *   Once all the dependencies have been updated and the tests are passing, create a pull request.
    *   The pull request should include a summary of the updated dependencies and any notable changes.

6.  **Review and merge:**
    *   The pull request will be reviewed by another developer.
    *   Once the pull request has been approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

## Notes

*   If a dependency update causes a significant breaking change, it should be addressed in a separate feature branch.
*   Security vulnerabilities should be addressed immediately and not wait for the weekly update schedule.
