## Guidelines

When adding design documentation:
1. Include both high-level architecture and detailed component designs
2. Use diagrams and visual aids where helpful
3. Link to related requirements in `../requirements/`
4. Document design decisions and trade-offs
5. Keep designs updated as implementation evolves
6. Update this index when adding new files
