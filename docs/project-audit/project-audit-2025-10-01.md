### Focus Areas

**Current Health**: 8.0/10 (declining from 10.0/10) - Good

**Primary Concerns**:
1. Deployment configuration (Vercel account setup)
2. GitHub → Vercel auto-deployment integration
3. Security documentation completion

**Security Posture**: 7.5/10 - Recent security incidents resulted in comprehensive RBAC system and AI restrictions. Ongoing validation required.

**Technical Excellence**: With 39,673 lines of code across 7,058 files, the codebase demonstrates Development Stage characteristics with 14 React components and modern TypeScript patterns.
