# Cancellation & Refund Policy

Life happens. We understand that sometimes you need to cancel a session. Here's how our cancellation policy works.

- Cancel less than 24 hours: **No refund**

**For Tutors:**

- No-show: Client gets **100% refund** + major reputation penalty

## Client Cancellations

### 24+ Hours Notice (Full Refund)

If you cancel **24 hours or more** before your session:
- ✅ **Full refund** to your original payment method (minus Stripe processing fee)
- ✅ Refund processed within 5-10 business days
- ✅ No questions asked
- ✅ No impact on your account

**About Stripe Processing Fees:**
When you pay for a session, Stripe (our payment processor) charges a small fee (1.5% + 20p for UK/EU cards). When we refund you, Stripe keeps this fee. This means if you paid £50, you'll receive approximately £49.05 back.

**How to Cancel:**
1. Go to **Bookings** in your dashboard
2. Find your upcoming session
3. Click **Cancel Booking**
4. Confirm cancellation
5. You'll receive a confirmation email with refund details

### Less Than 24 Hours Notice (No Refund)

If you cancel **less than 24 hours** before your session:
- ❌ **No refund** - tutor receives full payment
- ⚠️ This protects tutors who have blocked their time

**Why?** Tutors rely on advance notice to fill their slots. Last-minute cancellations mean they lose income with no time to find replacement students.

### Client No-Show

If you don't show up for a confirmed session:
- ❌ **No refund** - tutor receives full payment
- ⚠️ Repeated no-shows may affect your account standing

**Note:** If you're running late, message your tutor immediately. They may wait for you or offer to reschedule.

## Tutor Cancellations

We hold tutors to high professional standards. If a tutor cancels or doesn't show up, you're protected.

### Tutor Cancels (Any Time)

If your tutor cancels at any time before the session:
- ✅ **Full refund** to your original payment method (minus Stripe fee)
- ✅ Tutor's CaaS (reputation) score reduced by 10 points
- ✅ Lower CaaS score = lower search ranking for tutor
- 📧 You'll receive a notification with rebooking suggestions

**Example:** £50 session → you receive £49.05 refund (£50 - £0.95 Stripe fee)

### Tutor No-Show

If your tutor doesn't show up for a confirmed session:
- ✅ **Automatic full refund** (minus Stripe fee, no need to request)
- ✅ Tutor's CaaS score reduced by 50 points (major penalty)
- ⚠️ Repeated no-shows can lead to tutor account suspension
- 🎯 Refund processed within 24 hours

**Example:** £100 session → you receive £98.30 refund (£100 - £1.70 Stripe fee)

**To Report a No-Show:**
1. Wait 15 minutes past session start time
2. Go to your booking details
3. Click **Report No-Show**
4. Provide brief details
5. Refund is processed automatically

## Refund Process

### How Refunds Work

1. **Automatic Processing:** Refunds are processed automatically when you cancel with 24+ hours notice or report a tutor no-show
2. **Refund Amount:** You receive the full amount **minus Stripe's processing fee** (1.5% + 20p for UK/EU cards)
3. **Refund Timeline:** Money returns to your original payment method within 5-10 business days
4. **Confirmation Email:** You'll receive an email confirming your refund with expected timeline

### Refund Methods

- **Credit/Debit Card:** 5-7 business days
- **PayPal:** 3-5 business days
- **Bank Transfer:** 7-10 business days

**Note:** Refund timing depends on your bank's processing speed, not TutorWise.

### Why is the Stripe Fee Deducted?

When you make a payment, Stripe (our secure payment processor) charges a transaction fee. This fee is non-refundable—even when we issue a refund, Stripe keeps their processing fee. This is standard practice across all platforms using Stripe and protects the platform from absorbing these costs.

## Emergency Exceptions

### Medical Emergencies

1. Contact **support@tutorwise.com** within 24 hours
2. Provide medical documentation (doctor's note, hospital discharge, etc.)
3. Our team will review and may issue an exception refund

### Other Exceptional Circumstances

We handle these on a case-by-case basis:
- Family emergencies (with proof)

## Rescheduling vs Cancelling

### Rescheduling (Recommended)

Instead of cancelling, consider rescheduling:
- ✅ No refund needed - payment transfers to new date
- ✅ Keep your tutor (no need to rebook)
- ✅ No impact on either party

**How to Reschedule:**
1. Message your tutor in the booking chat
2. Agree on a new time
3. Click **Reschedule** in booking details
4. Confirm new time
5. Both parties receive confirmation

**Limit:** You can reschedule up to 4 times per booking. After that, you'll need to cancel and create a new booking.

---

## What Counts as "Session Start Time"?

The 24-hour cancellation window is based on your **confirmed session start time**.

**Example:**
- Session scheduled: Thursday 3:00 PM
- 24-hour cutoff: Wednesday 3:00 PM
- Cancel Wednesday 2:00 PM = Full refund ✅
- Cancel Wednesday 4:00 PM = No refund ❌

**Timezone:** All times are based on the timezone specified when booking was created (usually tutor's timezone).

## FAQs

### Can I cancel if my tutor is late?

If your tutor is **15+ minutes late** without notice:
- Wait 15 minutes past session start
- Try to contact them via platform messages
- If no response, report as no-show for automatic refund

### What if I have a technical issue?

If platform technical issues prevent your session:
- Contact support immediately during the session
- We'll investigate and issue full refund if confirmed
- Both parties protected - no penalty

### Can I cancel a recurring booking?

Yes, but:
- Each session follows the same 24-hour policy
- Cancel early sessions with 24+ hours notice for refund
- Later sessions can be cancelled individually

### What if my tutor cancels repeatedly?

- First cancellation: Full refund + 10 CaaS penalty (tutor)
- Repeated cancellations: Progressive CaaS penalties
- Consistent cancellers: Account review/suspension
- You're always protected with automatic refunds

## CaaS (Credibility as a Service) Explained

### What is CaaS?

CaaS is our tutor reputation system. Think of it like a credit score for tutors.

- High CaaS (100+): Top search ranking, more bookings
- Medium CaaS (50-100): Normal search ranking
- Low CaaS (0-50): Hidden from main search
- Negative CaaS (<0): Account suspended

### How CaaS is Affected

**Positive Actions:**
- Complete a session: +5 points
- Receive 5-star review: +10 points
- Perfect attendance (30 days): +25 points

**Negative Actions:**
- Cancel session: **-10 points**
- No-show: **-50 points**
- Client complaint: -20 points

**Recovery:** Tutors can rebuild CaaS through consistent delivery. 10 successful sessions = +50 points.
