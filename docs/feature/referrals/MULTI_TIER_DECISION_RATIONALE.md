**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-12-16
**Status**: Approved for 1-Tier Launch, 3-Tier Roadmap Defined
**Owner**: Growth Team + Legal

---

## Executive Summary

TutorWise will implement a **configurable multi-tier commission system** (1-7 tiers), launching conservatively with **Tier 1 only** (single-tier), with expansion to **Tier 2-3** after legal review and market validation.

**Initial Launch**: Tier 1 (10%) - Same as current system
**Future Expansion**: Tier 2 (3%), Tier 3 (1.5%) - Q2 2026 after legal clearance

This makes TutorWise the **first tutoring platform** with multi-tier MLM-style commissions, following the eXp Realty model from real estate.

## Why Multi-Tier?

### Business Drivers

**1. Viral Growth Engine**
- Single-tier: Agents recruit tutors → linear growth
- Multi-tier: Agents recruit agents who recruit tutors → exponential growth
- **Expected outcome**: 10x more tutors in Year 1 (10,000 vs 1,000)

**2. Passive Income Incentive**
- Agents at Tier 2+ earn without active recruiting
- Creates "super agents" with £30k/month passive income
- Increases agent retention and engagement

**3. Revenue Scale**
- Platform fee unchanged at 10% per booking
- More tutors = more bookings = more revenue
- **Projected revenue**: £12M/year (vs £1.2M single-tier) at 10,000 tutors

**4. Competitive Moat**
- First-mover advantage in tutoring industry
- Patent-protected referral system enhances defensibility
- Hard to replicate (legal/technical complexity)

### Market Validation

**Comparable Success Stories**:
- **eXp Realty**: $4.2B revenue, 89,000 agents, 7-tier commission structure
- **Mary Kay**: $3.25B revenue, 2-tier conservative model
- **Amway**: $8.9B revenue, 6-tier structure (aggressive)

**Why tutoring is different**:
- Service marketplace (not physical products)
- No inventory requirements (lower barrier to entry)
- Digital-first (easier global scaling)

## Why Start with 1-Tier Only?

### Conservative Launch Strategy

**1. Legal Risk Mitigation**
- Multi-tier = MLM structure = heightened regulatory scrutiny
- Launching Tier 1 only looks like standard affiliate program
- Allows market testing before legal exposure

**2. Market Testing**
- Validate tutor satisfaction with £80 earnings (80%)
- Test agent recruitment velocity
- Measure conversion rates (clicks → signups → bookings)
- Gather data for legal review

**3. Regulatory Compliance**
- No UK/EU precedent for multi-tier tutoring platforms
- Need 6-12 months operational data for legal opinion
- FTC (US) requires demonstrable product value before multi-tier approval

**4. Brand Reputation**
- Avoid "MLM tutoring platform" perception at launch
- Build trust as quality marketplace first
- Introduce multi-tier after brand establishment

### Activation Timeline

```
Month 0-6: Tier 1 only (10% commission)
  → Market testing
  → Earnings data collection
  → Agent recruitment patterns analysis

Month 6-9: Legal review
  → Submit operational data to law firm
  → FTC/ASA guidance review
  → Tier 2 clearance process

Month 9-12: Tier 2 activation (3% commission)
  → Gradual rollout (A/B test)
  → Monitor tutor satisfaction (£77 vs £80 earnings)
  → Track agent behavior changes

Month 12-18: Tier 2 optimization
  → Adjust commission rates if needed
  → Fraud detection refinement
  → Income disclosure publication

Month 18+: Consider Tier 3 (1.5% commission)
  → Requires separate legal review
  → Board approval needed
  → International expansion considerations
```

## Legal Analysis

### Is This a Pyramid Scheme?

**Short answer**: No, if implemented correctly.

**Legal Requirements Met**:

✅ **No recruitment fees** - Agents join for free
✅ **Real product/service** - Actual tutoring lessons delivered
✅ **Primary income from sales** - Commissions from bookings, not recruiting
✅ **Transparent disclosure** - All rates publicly documented
✅ **No inventory loading** - Service-based, no purchases required
✅ **70% rule** - 100% of revenue from client bookings (exceeds FTC 70% threshold)

**Risk Factors Mitigated**:

⚠️ **Tier limits** - Capped at 3 tiers initially (eXp uses 7, we're more conservative)
⚠️ **Tutor earnings** - Start at £80 (80%), only reduce to £77 (77%) with Tier 2
⚠️ **Income claims** - Publish realistic average earnings data
⚠️ **Fraud detection** - Automated systems to prevent self-dealing

### Regulatory Framework

**UK/EU Regulations**:
- Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008
- No explicit MLM ban (unlike China, Bangladesh)
- Requires clear income disclosure
- ASA (Advertising Standards Authority) monitors income claims

**US Regulations** (Future):
- FTC Act Section 5 (unfair/deceptive practices)
- Koscot test: Pyramid if income primarily from recruitment
- TutorWise passes: Income from bookings, not recruitment fees

**Compliance Strategy**:
1. Retain UK/EU MLM specialist law firm (estimated cost: £50k)
2. File proactive disclosure with ASA
3. Publish average earnings by tier on website
4. Quarterly legal reviews (Years 1-2)

## Ethical Considerations

### Transparency Commitment

**Required Disclosures**:
1. **Agent Dashboard**: Show potential earnings by tier with realistic ranges
2. **Website**: Publish average earnings data (updated quarterly)
3. **Signup Flow**: Clear explanation of multi-tier structure
4. **Legal Terms**: Updated T&Cs with MLM disclosure

**Example Disclosure**:
```
"TutorWise agents earn commissions when tutors they recruit complete bookings:
- Tier 1: 10% of booking value (direct referrals)
- Tier 2: 3% of booking value (indirect referrals, FUTURE)

Average agent earnings (Q1 2026):
- New agents (0-3 months): £120/month
- Active agents (3-12 months): £450/month
- Super agents (12+ months, top 10%): £2,100/month

These earnings are NOT guaranteed and depend on your recruiting efforts
and the performance of tutors you refer."
```

### Tutor Protection

**Earnings Protection**:
- Tier 1 launch: Tutors keep 80% (unchanged)
- Tier 2 activation: Tutors get 77% (communicated 90 days in advance)
- Earnings offset: Top tutors get bonus programs to offset reduction

**Quality Standards**:
- All tutors undergo approval process
- Bad tutors can be removed (agents don't earn from poor quality)
- Student reviews visible to all

## Decision

**APPROVED**: Implement configurable multi-tier system
**INITIAL CONFIG**: Tier 1 only (10%)
**EXPANSION TIMELINE**: Tier 2 in Q2 2026 (subject to legal clearance)

**Rationale**: High reward potential (10x growth), manageable risk (conservative launch), legal defensibility (1-tier initially), competitive advantage (industry first).

---

## Appendix: Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Configurable vs Hardcoded
**Chosen**: Configurable via database table
**Rationale**: Allows instant tier activation/deactivation for regulatory compliance

### Decision 2: 3-Tier Max vs 7-Tier Max
**Chosen**: 7 tier table, 3-tier target, 1-tier launch
**Rationale**: Future-proof while staying conservative

### Decision 3: Platform Fee Adjustment
**Chosen**: Keep platform at fixed 10%
**Rationale**: Tutors absorb multi-tier costs (£80 → £77), not platform

### Decision 4: Immediate Launch vs Wait for Legal
**Chosen**: Launch Tier 1 immediately, wait for Tier 2
**Rationale**: Tier 1 is legally safe, no delay needed

### Decision 5: Transparent vs Hidden Structure
**Chosen**: Fully transparent with public disclosures
**Rationale**: Legal requirement, builds trust, reduces pyramid concerns
