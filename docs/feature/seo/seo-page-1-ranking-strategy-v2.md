**What Gets Cited by Perplexity**:
1. **Authoritative Sources**: .edu, .gov, established brands
2. **Always Includes Citations**: Direct source attribution
3. **Recent Content**: Dated, timestamped articles
4. **Statistical Evidence**: Data-backed claims

**3. Server-Side Rendering** (AI Crawler Requirement):
> "AI crawlers don't interact with JavaScript"

**Current Status**: ✅ Tutorwise uses Next.js SSR (already compliant)

**Verify**:
- Test with JavaScript disabled
- Ensure all content renders server-side
- Check dynamic routes render properly

**4. Sitemap Strategy**:

Create **multiple targeted sitemaps**:

```xml
<!-- Main Sitemap Index -->
<sitemapindex>
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://tutorwise.com/sitemap-profiles.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-12-23</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://tutorwise.com/sitemap-listings.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-12-23</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://tutorwise.com/sitemap-categories.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-12-23</lastmod>
  </sitemap>

  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://tutorwise.com/sitemap-help.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-12-23</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
</sitemapindex>
```

**Priority Settings**:
- Homepage: 1.0
- Hub pages (GCSE, A-Level, London): 0.9
- Spoke pages (GCSE Maths, GCSE English): 0.8
- Listings (individual tutors): 0.7
- Blog/Research: 0.6
- Help Centre: 0.5

**Change Frequency**:
- Listings: weekly (tutors update profiles)
- Categories: weekly (new tutors added)
- Research: monthly (new studies)
- Static pages: monthly

#### 2.4.2 Canonical URL Strategy

**Prevent Duplicate Content** (Etsy's approach):

**Problem**: Multiple URLs for same content
- `/subjects/gcse-maths`
- `/subjects/gcse-maths?location=london`
- `/subjects/gcse-maths?price=low`

**Solution**: Canonical tags
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://tutorwise.com/subjects/gcse-maths" />
```

**Rules**:
1. Filtered pages canonical to main category
2. Paginated pages self-canonical (page 2 → page 2, not page 1)
3. Location variations canonical to location-specific page
4. Never canonical to external URLs

#### 2.4.3 Site Architecture (Flat Structure)

**Etsy's Principle**: "Everything within 3 clicks"

**Tutorwise Implementation**:

```
Click 1: Homepage
Click 2: Category (GCSE Tutors / London Tutors)
Click 3: Listing (Specific Tutor)
```

**Maximum Depth**: 3 levels
- Level 1: Homepage
- Level 2: Hub pages (subjects, locations, service types)
- Level 3: Spoke pages + Listings

**NO 4th or 5th level pages**

**URL Structure**:
```
✅ GOOD (Flat):
/subjects/gcse
/subjects/gcse/maths
/subjects/gcse/maths/london
/listings/[id]/[slug]

❌ BAD (Deep):
/education/secondary/gcse/subjects/maths/tutors/london
```
