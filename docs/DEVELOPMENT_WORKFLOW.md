## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Basic Health Check**
```bash
npm run workflow:check
```
Runs: Dependencies, linting, type checking

### 2. **Full Development Workflow**
```bash
npm run workflow:full
```
Runs: Check → Test → Build → Deploy validation

### 3. **Fix Common Issues**
```bash
npm run workflow:fix-tests
```
Updates test snapshots and fixes common test issues

## 🛠️ Development Workflow Script

Our `scripts/dev-workflow.sh` provides comprehensive automation for the development process:

### Available Commands

| Command | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `check` | Quick health check (lint, types, deps) | Before starting work |
| `test` | Comprehensive testing suite | After implementing features |
| `build` | Build verification with all checks | Before committing |
| `deploy` | Validate readiness for deployment | Before pushing to main |
| `fix-tests` | Fix failing tests and update snapshots | When tests are broken |
| `clean` | Clean project and reinstall dependencies | When having dependency issues |
| `full` | Complete workflow (recommended) | Regular development cycle |

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick check before starting work
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh check

# Full workflow before committing
npm run workflow:full

# Fix test issues
npm run workflow:fix-tests

# Clean start after dependency changes
npm run workflow:clean
```

---

## 🔄 Daily Development Process

### **Phase 1: Pre-Development Setup**
```bash
# 1. Check project health
npm run workflow:check

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### **Phase 2: Feature Development**
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Run quick checks frequently
npm run workflow:check

# 3. Test your changes
npm run workflow:test
```

### **Phase 3: Pre-Commit Validation**
```bash
# 1. Run full workflow
npm run workflow:full

# 2. If successful, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
```

### **Phase 4: Pre-Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Validate deployment readiness
npm run workflow:deploy

# 2. Push to repository
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Create pull request or merge to main
```

## 🔒 Quality Gates

Our workflow enforces multiple quality gates to catch issues early:

### **Gate 1: Code Quality**
- ✅ ESLint analysis with auto-fix
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scan

### **Gate 2: Testing**
- ✅ Unit tests with coverage
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Component tests

### **Gate 3: Build Verification**
- ✅ Production build success
- ✅ Bundle size optimization
- ✅ Asset generation

### **Gate 4: Deployment Readiness**
- ✅ Git status clean
- ✅ All previous gates passed
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### ❌ **Linting Errors**
```bash
# Auto-fix most linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Or run the full check with auto-fix
npm run workflow:check
```

#### ❌ **Type Errors**
```bash
# Check types manually
npm run typecheck

# Common fixes:
# 1. Add missing type imports
# 2. Fix type annotations
# 3. Update interface definitions
```

#### ❌ **Test Failures**
```bash
# Fix test snapshots and common issues
npm run workflow:fix-tests

# Run tests with verbose output
npm run test:unit -- --verbose
```

#### ❌ **Build Failures**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run workflow:clean

# Check build output for specific errors
npm run build
```

#### ❌ **Dependency Issues**
```bash
# Clean reinstall
npm run workflow:clean

# Update dependencies
npm update

# Audit and fix security issues
npm audit fix
```

## 🏆 Best Practices

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Start Each Day with Health Check**
   ```bash
   npm run workflow:check
   ```

2. **Run Tests After Each Feature**
   ```bash
   npm run workflow:test
   ```

3. **Full Validation Before Committing**
   ```bash
   npm run workflow:full
   ```

4. **Fix Issues Immediately**
   - Don't accumulate technical debt
   - Use auto-fix tools when available
   - Address warnings before they become errors

### **Code Quality Standards**

1. **TypeScript First**
   - Always type your interfaces
   - Use strict type checking
   - Avoid `any` types

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Update tests when changing functionality
   - Maintain good test coverage

3. **Git Workflow**
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Keep commits atomic and focused
   - Run full workflow before pushing

### **Performance Optimization**

1. **Bundle Size Monitoring**
   - Check build output for size warnings
   - Optimize imports and dependencies
   - Use code splitting for large features

2. **Build Time Optimization**
   - Clean project when dependencies change
   - Use incremental builds during development
   - Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance

## 🤖 Automation & CI/CD

### **GitHub Actions Integration**

Our workflow is integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **On Push to Main**: Full workflow validation
- **On Pull Request**: Quality checks and testing
- **On Release**: Complete deployment pipeline

### **Local vs CI Environment**

| Check | Local Script | GitHub Actions |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Linting | ✅ Auto-fix enabled | ✅ Strict checking |
| Type Checking | ✅ Fast incremental | ✅ Full check |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Quick mode | ✅ Full coverage |
| Build | ✅ Development mode | ✅ Production mode |
| E2E Tests | ⚡ On demand | ✅ Automated |

- **Time to First Check**: `workflow:check` completion time
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained above 80%
- **Build Success Rate**: Target 100% on main branch
- **Deployment Frequency**: Measure time from commit to production
