## üéØ Critical Path Items

**Must be completed in order:**

1. ‚úÖ **Week 0:** Canonical taxonomy (BLOCKS Phase 0)
2. ‚úÖ **Week 0-2:** Figma designs (BLOCKS Phase 0 UI)
3. **Week 2-3:** Database schema (BLOCKS everything)
4. **Week 3-4:** API layer (BLOCKS UI development)
5. **Week 10-11:** AI infrastructure (BLOCKS Phase 1)
6. **Week 18-19:** Neo4j setup (BLOCKS Phase 2)

**If any of these are delayed, all subsequent phases are delayed.**

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Taxonomy incompleteness
**Impact:** Poor search quality, matching failures
**Mitigation:**
- Allocate dedicated resource for taxonomy research
- Validate with educators before Phase 0
- Plan for taxonomy updates without schema changes

### Risk 2: AI service latency
**Impact:** Slow conversational wizard, poor UX
**Mitigation:**
- Use fast LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo or Llama 3 8B)
- Implement client-side loading states
- Cache common queries
- Set timeout limits (5s max)

### Risk 3: Graph database performance
**Impact:** Slow trust score calculations
**Mitigation:**
- Index critical relationships
- Cache trust scores (update daily, not real-time)
- Use read replicas for queries
- Limit graph depth (max 2 hops)

### Risk 4: Scope creep
**Impact:** Timeline delays
**Mitigation:**
- Strict phase boundaries
- No new features mid-phase
- Defer nice-to-haves to Phase 3
- Weekly sprint reviews
