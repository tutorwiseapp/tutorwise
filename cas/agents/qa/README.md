# QA Agent - QA Engineer

**Role:** AI QA Engineer & Usability Specialist
**Responsibilities:** Accessibility testing, visual regression, usability validation, cross-browser testing

---

## Overview

The QA agent ensures quality standards, validates usability, and performs visual regression testing. It focuses on accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), cross-browser compatibility, and user experience.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Automated Visual Verification (NEW - PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY)
- **Purpose:** Act as the automated gatekeeper for UI quality and design system adherence.
- **Trigger:** Runs automatically when the Developer Agent completes a UI task and pushes Storybook stories.
- **Process:**
    1. Uses a visual regression tool (e.g., Percy) to take snapshots of all new and updated Storybook stories.
    2. Compares these snapshots against the approved baseline from the `main` branch.
- **Gatekeeping:**
    - **On Success:** Automatically approves the changes and adds a "✅ Visual Verification Passed" status to the PR.
    - **On Failure:** Automatically **blocks the PR** and assigns a task back to the Developer Agent with a report of the visual regressions.
- **Reference:** [Visual Verification Workflow](../../process/VISUAL-VERIFICATION-WORKFLOW.md)
