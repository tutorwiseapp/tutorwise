## Engineer Agent Notes

### Infrastructure Patterns Established
1. **FastAPI Structure:** Modular routers with dependency injection
2. **Database Migrations:** SQL files with timestamps
3. **API Clients:** TypeScript with proper error handling
4. **Testing Setup:** Jest + Playwright + Percy integration
5. **Configuration:** Environment variables with .env files

### Lessons Learned
1. **Start monitoring early** - Week 2 priority
2. **Automate testing** - CI/CD essential for quality
3. **Performance baselines** - Measure before optimizing
4. **Security layers** - Authentication ‚úÖ, need rate limiting

### Next Sprint Focus
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Monitoring and observability
- Performance optimization (caching)
- Service Listings infrastructure preparation
