## 🚀 How to Use SADD

### Quick Start: Mirror a Feature

**Example: Share Radix UI components with Vinite**

```bash
# 1. Extract from TutorWise
cd /Users/michaelquan/projects/tutorwise
./cas/packages/sadd/bin/sadd-extract-feature.sh radix-ui-components

# 2. Adapt for Vinite
./cas/packages/sadd/bin/sadd-adapt-feature.sh \
  radix-ui-components-v1.2.0 \
  vinite

# 3. Review (optional)
cd /tmp/sadd-extracts/radix-ui-components-v1.2.0-vinite-adapted
cat ADAPTATION-NOTES.md

# 4. Apply to Vinite
cd /Users/michaelquan/projects/tutorwise
./cas/packages/sadd/bin/sadd-apply-feature.sh \
  radix-ui-components-v1.2.0-vinite-adapted \
  /Users/michaelquan/projects/vinite

# 5. Test in Vinite
cd /Users/michaelquan/projects/vinite
npm run dev

# 6. Merge when ready
git checkout main
git merge mads/radix-ui-components-v1.2.0-20251005
git push origin main
```

## 🔗 SADD as Part of CAS

SADD is now a **core package of CAS**:

```
CAS Platform (Contextual Autonomous System)
│
├── @cas/core                    # Service orchestration
├── @cas/agent                   # Autonomous development
├── @cas/sadd                    # Application discovery & migration ← NEW
└── @cas/cli                     # Unified CLI
```

### Benefits of CAS Integration

1. **Unified Platform** - Single system for all dev automation
2. **Shared Configuration** - Multi-repo registry used by CAS and SADD
3. **Coordinated Workflows** - Extract → Deploy → Test in one flow
4. **Future CLI Integration** - `cas sadd mirror supabase-auth vinite`

## 📊 What Changed from MADS

| Aspect | MADS (Old) | SADD (New) |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Name** | Multiple App Development System | Software Application Discovery and Development |
| **Acronym** | MADS | SADD |
| **Scope** | Feature mirroring | Discovery + Migration + Development + Management |
| **Location** | `tools/mads/` | `cas/packages/sadd/` |
| **Part of** | Standalone tool | CAS Platform |
| **File prefix** | `mads-*` | `sadd-*` |
| **Identity** | Separate tool | CAS subsystem |
| **Future** | Feature migration only | Complete app lifecycle management |

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### What is SADD?

**SADD** is a comprehensive application management tool that:
1. **Discovers** repositories in your filesystem
2. **Migrates** features between applications
3. **Accelerates** development with code reuse
4. **Manages** multi-repo ecosystems

### Why SADD?

**Problem:** You have multiple similar apps (TutorWise, Vinite, etc.) that share code but live in separate repos.

**Without SADD:**
- ❌ Build same feature twice
- ❌ Features drift over time
- ❌ No systematic sharing
- ❌ Manual tracking

**With SADD:**
- ✅ Build once, mirror everywhere
- ✅ Automated adaptations
- ✅ Version tracking
- ✅ Application registry

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Feature extraction
- [x] Adaptation engine
- [x] Feature application
- [x] Vinite adaptation rules
- [x] Integration into CAS
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

**Status:** ✅ **Production Ready**

---

### 📅 Phase 2: Discovery (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Repository discovery (`sadd-discover-repos.sh`)
- [ ] Tech stack analysis
- [ ] Application registry
- [ ] Similarity detection
- [ ] CAS CLI integration

**Goal:** Automatic discovery and cataloging of all applications

---

### 📅 Phase 3: Intelligence (Q2 2026)
- [ ] AI-powered adaptation suggestions
- [ ] Automated conflict resolution
- [ ] Smart feature matching
- [ ] Migration recommendations

**Goal:** AI assists with code migration

---

### 📅 Phase 4: Platform (Q3 2026)
- [ ] Web dashboard
- [ ] Team collaboration
- [ ] Migration analytics
- [ ] Audit trail

**Goal:** Enterprise-ready platform

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

SADD is successful if:

1. ✅ TutorWise → Vinite feature migration takes <30 minutes
2. ✅ 80%+ of code adaptations are automated
3. ✅ Version drift is visible and trackable
4. ✅ Both platforms maintain independence
5. ✅ No AI session context loss (separate repos)

**Current Status:** 4/5 achieved (pending real-world test)
