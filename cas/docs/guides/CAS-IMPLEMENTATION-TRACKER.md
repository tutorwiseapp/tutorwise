## 📋 Active Development (Q4 2025)

### TutorWise Milestone: Testing Infrastructure & Quality Assurance (GUARD)

**Date Started:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** 🟢 In Progress

#### TutorWise Requirements:
- Comprehensive unit testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- E2E testing (Playwright)
- Visual regression testing (Percy)
- Component testing (Storybook - blocked by Next.js 14 incompatibility)
- Test coverage reporting
- CI/CD integration

#### Current Status:
- ✅ **TutorProfessionalInfoForm:** 15/15 tests passing | 83.95% coverage
- 🟡 **ProfilePage:** 2/24 tests passing | Complex component structure issues
- ✅ **Percy Visual Regression:** 4 snapshots integrated
- 🔴 **Storybook:** Blocked by webpack incompatibility (using Percy alternative)
- 🔴 **ClientProfessionalInfoForm:** Not implemented (placeholder only)
- 🔴 **AgentProfessionalInfoForm:** Not implemented (placeholder only)

#### CAS Enhancements Being Built:

| Feature | Status | Autonomy Impact | Priority |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| GUARD test orchestration | 🟢 Active | +12% | P0 |
| Automated test coverage reporting | 📋 Planned | +5% | P0 |
| Visual regression baseline management | 🟡 Partial | +4% | P1 |
| Component complexity detection | 📋 Planned | +6% | P1 |
| Test gap analysis | 📋 Planned | +7% | P1 |
| Auto-fix failing tests | 📋 Planned | +10% | P2 |

**CAS Commands Being Added:**
```bash
guard run [suite]             # Run test suites (unit, e2e, visual)
guard coverage                # Generate coverage report
guard analyze                 # Analyze test gaps
guard fix                     # Auto-fix common test issues
guard baseline create         # Create visual baselines
guard baseline approve        # Approve visual changes
```

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Component Testability:** Complex nested components (ProfilePage: Container → Tabs → Cards → Form) make unit testing difficult
2. **Implementation Discovery:** Always verify component implementation exists before planning tests
3. **Alternative Solutions:** When Storybook blocked, Percy + Playwright provided visual regression testing
4. **Coverage Quality:** 83.95% coverage achievable with straightforward component structure

**Action Items:**
- 🔴 **Implement ClientProfessionalInfoForm** (placeholder → full component)
- 🔴 **Implement AgentProfessionalInfoForm** (placeholder → full component)
- 🟡 **Refactor ProfilePage** for testability (or accept E2E-only coverage)
- ✅ **Continue TutorProfessionalInfoForm pattern** for new components

**Generalization Strategy:**
- Test complexity detection for any React/Vue/Angular component
- Visual regression for any UI framework
- Coverage gap analysis for any language
- Auto-fix patterns for common test failures
