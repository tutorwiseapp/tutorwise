## Next Steps - Week 3+ Planning

### Immediate Priorities

#### 1. Activate Auto-Plan Updaters (4 hours)

**Developer Agent:**
- Implement `FeaturePlanUpdater` class
- Connect to Claude Code's TodoWrite tool
- Auto-update `cas/agents/developer/planning/cas-feature-dev-plan.md`

**Engineer Agent:**
- Implement `SystemPlanUpdater` class
- Connect to deployment/monitoring events
- Auto-update `cas/agents/engineer/planning/cas-system-imp-plan.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- Plans update automatically after each todo completion
- No manual editing required
- Real-time reflection of project state

---

#### 2. Implement Planner Orchestration (4 hours)

**Planner Agent:**
- Build `PlannerOrchestrator` class
- Implement blocker detection logic
- Create agent communication layer

**Success Criteria:**
- Automatic feature workflow: Analyst → Developer → Tester → QA → Engineer
- Blocker detection without human intervention
- Status reporting to shared context

---

#### 3. E2E Testing for New Forms (6 hours)

**Tester Agent:**
- Create E2E tests for ClientProfessionalInfoForm
- Create E2E tests for AgentProfessionalInfoForm
- Integrate with Percy for visual regression

**Success Criteria:**
- E2E tests passing across all browsers
- Percy snapshots created for Client & Agent forms
- Visual regression baselines established

---

#### 4. Resolve Storybook Webpack Issue (Optional)

**Options:**
1. Try Storybook 9 beta
2. Wait for official Next.js 14 + Storybook 8 compatibility fix
3. Continue using Percy without Storybook (current approach)

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (continue with Percy) - lowest risk, already working

---

### Backlog Features

**User Authentication:**
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook)
- Email verification flow
- Password reset flow

**Onboarding Wizard:**
- Multi-step wizard UI
- Progress indicator
- Auto-save integration (API already complete)

**Profile Management:**
- Profile photo upload
- Account settings
- Notification preferences

**Search & Matching:**
- Tutor search by subject/location
- Matching algorithm (students → tutors)
- Booking system

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Pattern Reuse Accelerated Development**
   - Week 1 TutorProfessionalInfoForm provided excellent template
   - Same patterns applied to Client & Agent forms
   - Minimal bugs due to proven architecture

2. **Comprehensive Testing Prevented Regressions**
   - 48/48 tests passing first time
   - High coverage (89.71%) caught edge cases
   - Clear test structure made debugging easy

3. **Enhanced CAS Structure Improved Organization**
   - Clear agent roles reduced confusion
   - Todo tracking kept work focused
   - Documentation stayed current

4. **No Blockers Encountered**
   - Smooth execution from start to finish
   - All patterns proven in Week 1
   - API already built (Onboarding API)

### What Could Improve 🟡

1. **Auto-Plan Updaters Not Yet Active**
   - Plans still updated manually
   - Week 3 priority: Activate auto-updaters
   - Will reduce manual overhead significantly

2. **Storybook Still Blocked**
   - Same webpack issue from Week 1
   - Not blocking progress (using Percy instead)
   - Can revisit when Storybook 9 or Next.js 15 releases

3. **Limited Security Agent Activity**
   - No security testing in Week 2
   - Forms handle user input → security critical
   - Week 3: Activate Security agent for form validation review

### Continuous Improvement Actions 🔄

**For Week 3:**
1. ✅ Activate auto-plan updaters (Developer & Engineer agents)
2. ✅ Implement Planner orchestration logic
3. ✅ Conduct security review of all 3 forms
4. ✅ Create E2E tests for Client & Agent forms
