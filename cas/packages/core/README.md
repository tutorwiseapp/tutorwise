# CAS Core Package

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Description:** Core package for the Contextual Autonomous System (CAS). It handles service orchestration, context generation, and system management.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The `@cas/core` package is the central nervous system of the CAS platform. It provides the foundational capabilities for managing the various AI agents and system services, ensuring they operate in a coordinated and efficient manner.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The package is structured into several key areas:

- **`src/context`**: Handles the generation and management of the codebase context map for AI agents.
- **`src/integrations`**: Manages connections to external services like Jira and Google Calendar.
- **`src/service`**: (Under Refinement) Responsible for service orchestration, including a service registry and lifecycle management.
- **`src/utils`**: Contains utility functions, such as logging and configuration management.
- **`src/config`**: Manages system-wide configuration.

## üöÄ Core Package Refinement Plan

This package is currently undergoing refinement to implement the full vision of the CAS platform. The following tasks are planned:

### 1. Service Orchestration Layer (`src/service`)
- [ ] **Service Registry:** Implement a central registry to discover and manage all available services (e.g., AI agents, monitoring services).
- [ ] **Service Lifecycle Management:** Create a mechanism to start, stop, and monitor the health of registered services.
- [ ] **Service Communication:** Establish a simple bus or communication channel for services to interact.

### 2. System Management (`src/utils`, `src/config`)
- [ ] **Logging Utility:** Implement a standardized logger for consistent logging across the system.
- [ ] **Configuration Management:** Enhance configuration handling to support different environments (development, production).

### 3. Documentation
- [x] **Create README.md:** This file.
- [ ] **Add JSDoc comments:** Document the public API of the core modules.

### 4. Testing (`tests/`)
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Service Orchestration:** Write tests for the service registry and lifecycle management.
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Utilities:** Add tests for the logging and configuration utilities.

## üíª Usage

### Scripts

- **`npm run generate-context`**: Generates the codebase context map.
- **`npm run setup`**: Sets up and verifies the context engineering system.
- **`npm run jira`**: Runs the Jira integration script.
