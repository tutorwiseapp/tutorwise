**New to Tutorwise?** Follow these steps in order to get up and running quickly.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 1: Complete Your Profile

Your profile is your first impression to potential students. Make it count!

### Profile Photo
- Use a professional, high-quality headshot
- Smile! Students prefer friendly, approachable tutors
- Ensure good lighting and a clean background

### Bio & Introduction
Write a compelling bio that highlights:
- Your teaching experience and qualifications
- Your teaching philosophy
- What makes you unique as a tutor
- Your specialties and subjects

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best Practice**: Keep your bio under 200 words and focus on how you help students succeed, not just your credentials.
</CalloutBox>

### Education & Experience
- Add all relevant degrees and certifications
- List your teaching experience (years, subjects, levels)
- Include any notable achievements or awards

## Step 2: Create Your First Listing

Listings are how students discover you. Each listing represents a subject or service you offer.

### What to Include

1. **Subject & Level**: Be specific (e.g., "GCSE Mathematics" not just "Maths")
2. **Pricing**: Research competitive rates in your area
3. **Session Types**: Online, in-person, or both?
4. **Availability**: Set your regular teaching hours

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Online Sessions">
    For online sessions:
    - Ensure you have stable internet
    - Use a quiet, well-lit space
    - Test your camera and microphone
    - Familiarize yourself with our video platform
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="In-Person Sessions">
    For in-person sessions:
    - Specify your teaching location
    - Set clear boundaries about travel distance
    - Consider charging travel fees if applicable
    - Ensure you have appropriate insurance
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Connect Your Stripe Account

Before you can receive payments, you need to connect a Stripe account.

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Important**: You cannot accept bookings until your Stripe account is connected and verified.
</CalloutBox>

### How to Connect Stripe

1. Go to **Account → Payments**
2. Click "Connect Stripe Account"
3. Follow the Stripe onboarding process
4. Provide required verification documents
5. Wait for approval (usually 1-2 business days)

### Required Information
- Government-issued ID
- Bank account details for payouts
- Tax information (if applicable)
- Business details (if operating as a company)

## Step 4: Set Your Availability

Students can only book slots when you're available. Keep your calendar updated!

### Calendar Best Practices

- **Set recurring availability** for regular teaching hours
- **Block out personal time** to avoid burnout
- **Update immediately** if plans change
- **Allow buffer time** between sessions (15-30 minutes)

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Note**: Students book more when they see consistent, predictable availability.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 5: Wait for Your First Booking

Once your profile is complete, listings are live, and Stripe is connected, you're ready to receive bookings!

### What Happens Next?

1. **Student requests booking** → You receive email notification
2. **Review booking details** → Check date, time, subject
3. **Accept or decline** → You have 24 hours to respond
4. **Prepare for session** → Review student's learning goals
5. **Deliver session** → Teach and engage
6. **Get paid** → Funds released 24 hours after session

### Response Time Matters

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Note**: Responding quickly increases your booking acceptance rate. Students often book with the first tutor who responds.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 6: Build Your Reputation

After each session, students can leave reviews. Great reviews = more bookings!

### How to Get 5-Star Reviews

- **Be punctual**: Always show up on time
- **Come prepared**: Review materials beforehand
- **Be patient**: Every student learns at their own pace
- **Follow up**: Send resources or homework after sessions
- **Ask for feedback**: Politely request reviews from happy students
