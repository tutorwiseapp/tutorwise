</CalloutBox>

### Managing Team Members

**Change Roles:**

**Remove Members:**

## Step 3: Track Referrals

Organisations have access to a powerful referral pipeline to track and manage referrals.

### Referral Pipeline Example

The 6-stage pipeline lets you manually track referrals as you nurture them towards conversion. Here's an example:

**Example: Maths Tutor Refers English Tutor**
1. **Referred** - Sarah creates referral entry for Tom in the pipeline
2. **Contacted** - Sarah manually moves to this stage after emailing Tom about joining
3. **Meeting Set** - Sarah manually moves here after scheduling a call with Tom
4. **Proposal Sent** - Sarah manually moves here after Tom signs up and creates profile
5. **Negotiating** - Sarah manually moves here as Tom starts getting clients
6. **Won** - Automatically updates when Tom completes a paid booking (Sarah earns commission)

**Another Example: Tutor Refers Client**
1. **Referred** - Organisation member creates referral entry for potential client
2. **Contacted** - Manually moved after sending initial outreach email
3. **Meeting Set** - Manually moved after client schedules discovery call
4. **Proposal Sent** - Manually moved after sending lesson package proposal
5. **Negotiating** - Manually moved when client negotiates pricing/schedule
6. **Won** - Automatically updates when client completes first booking (commission earned)

### Using the Pipeline

**Access Pipeline:**
- Go to Organisation → Referrals tab
- View all referrals across all stages
- Drag-and-drop cards between stages

**Add New Referral:**
- Click "Add Referral"
- Enter details (name, email, estimated value)
- Automatically starts in "Referred" stage

**Move Through Pipeline:**
- Drag referral card to next stage
- Pipeline automatically tracks time in each stage
- Monitor conversion rates and drop-offs

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best Practice:** Move referrals to "Contacted" within 24 hours of "Referred" stage for highest conversion rates (industry benchmark: 60% when contacted within 1 day).
</CalloutBox>

### Conversion Analytics

**Track Performance:**
- Stage conversion rates (Referred → Won)
- Average days to progress each stage
- Drop-off identification
- Revenue forecasting (conservative, realistic, optimistic)
- Filter by date range (30d, 90d, all-time)
- Compare member performance

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Goal:** Aim for 30%+ conversion from Referred → Won within 30 days for healthy recruitment pipeline.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 4: View Your Clients

The Clients tab aggregates all students/clients who have booked with tutors in your organisation.

### Client Dashboard

**Access Clients:**
- Go to Organisation → Clients tab
- View all clients who have booked with your tutors
- See total bookings per client

**Available Data:**

**Export Functionality:**

## Step 5: Task Management

### Task Pipeline (Kanban)

**5 Status Stages:**
1. **Backlog** - Future tasks, not yet prioritised
2. **Todo** - Ready to start
3. **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **Approved** - Completed, awaiting approval (if required)
5. **Done** - Finished

**Use Cases:**

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Example Task:** "Follow up with Sarah (Referred stage)" - Category: Admin, Priority: High, Assigned to: Recruitment Lead, Linked to: Referral #1234

## Step 8: Build Your Organisation Credibility Score

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Organisation CaaS is Live!** Your organisation now has its own credibility score based on team quality and professional verification.
</CalloutBox>

### Why Organisation CaaS Matters

Your Organisation Credibility Score (CaaS) is a 0-106 rating that shows clients, tutors, and the platform that your team delivers quality education.

**Benefits of High Organisation CaaS (80+):**
- Higher visibility in search results
- Featured in "Top Organisations" directory
- Easier tutor recruitment (tutors want to join successful teams)
- Client trust and premium pricing justified
- Priority placement in recommendations

### How Organisation CaaS is Calculated

**Base Score: Activity-Weighted Team Average (0-100 points)**

Your organisation's base score is the weighted average of your active team members' individual CaaS scores:

1. Each team member has their own CaaS score (Tutor, Client, Agent, or Student)
2. Members are weighted by their session activity in the last 90 days
   - High activity (20+ sessions): Full weight
   - Medium activity (10-19 sessions): Moderate weight
   - Low activity (1-9 sessions): Reduced weight
   - Inactive (0 sessions): Not counted
3. Minimum requirement: At least 3 active members for a valid score

**Verification Bonuses (up to +6 points):**
- Business Verified: +2 points
- Safeguarding Certified: +2 points (all members have enhanced DBS)
- Professional Insurance: +1 point (public liability + professional indemnity)
- Association Member: +1 point (e.g., ISA, NAHT membership)

**Example:**
```
Your organisation has 5 active tutors:
- Tutor A: CaaS 92 (30 sessions in 90d) → High weight
- Tutor B: CaaS 85 (18 sessions in 90d) → Medium weight
- Tutor C: CaaS 88 (22 sessions in 90d) → High weight
- Tutor D: CaaS 70 (8 sessions in 90d) → Low weight
- Tutor E: CaaS 78 (12 sessions in 90d) → Medium weight

Weighted Average: ~85/100
+ Business Verified: +2
+ Safeguarding Certified: +2
+ Professional Insurance: +1

Final Organisation CaaS: 90/100
```

### How to Improve Your Organisation Score

**Quick Wins (1-2 Weeks):**
1. Complete business verification (+2 points)
2. Obtain professional insurance (+1 point)
3. Remove permanently inactive team members
4. Help active tutors improve their individual scores

**Medium-Term (1-3 Months):**
1. Recruit high-quality tutors (CaaS 70+)
2. Encourage active tutors to complete more sessions
3. Achieve safeguarding certification for all members (+2 points)
4. Join educational associations (+1 point)

**Long-Term (3-12 Months):**
1. Build a high-performing team culture (average CaaS 80+)
2. Provide professional development training
3. Maintain consistent team activity (20+ sessions/tutor/month)
4. Focus on quality over quantity

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Strategic Insight:** An organisation with 5 highly active tutors (CaaS 85+) will score higher than one with 20 inactive tutors (CaaS 60). Focus on quality and activity.
</CalloutBox>

### Organisation vs Agent CaaS

**Important:** If you're an agent who owns this organisation, you have **TWO separate credibility scores**:

1. **Your Agent CaaS** (personal): Based on your recruitment performance → shown on your profile
2. **Your Organisation CaaS** (entity): Based on your team's quality → shown on organisation page

Both scores serve different purposes:
- **Agent CaaS**: Helps recruit new tutors
- **Organisation CaaS**: Helps win client trust and bookings

Learn more in our complete [Credibility Score Guide](/help-centre/features/caas).
