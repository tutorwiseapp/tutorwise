## What is an Agent on Tutorwise?

Agents are network builders who connect tutors with students at scale. As an agent, you can:

- Build and manage a network of tutors
- Connect students with qualified tutors
- Earn commissions on all network activity
- Delegate referral commissions to grow faster
- Access organization-level analytics and tools

## Step 1: Complete Your Agent Profile

### Organization Details
Set up your organization information:
- Organization name and branding
- Business registration details (if applicable)
- Contact information and support channels
- Service area and specializations

### Profile Photo and Bio
- Use a professional headshot or organization logo
- Write a compelling bio explaining your mission
- Highlight your network's unique value proposition
- Describe the types of tutors and students you work with

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best Practice**: Position yourself as a trusted education partner, not just a service provider. Students and parents value relationships.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 2: Set Up Payment Details

### Connect Your Stripe Account
Before earning commissions, you need to set up payments:

1. Go to **Account** → **Payments**
2. Click **Connect Stripe Account**
3. Complete Stripe's verification process
4. Add your bank account details
5. Verify your identity (required for payouts)

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Verification Time**: Stripe verification typically takes 1-2 business days. You can start building your network while waiting.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 3: Build Your Tutor Network

### Recruiting Tutors

**Where to Find Tutors:**
- Teacher training programs and universities
- Teaching associations and forums
- Social media groups for educators
- Existing tutoring communities
- Professional networks like LinkedIn

**What Tutors Look For:**
- Steady stream of student referrals
- Fair commission structures
- Professional support and training
- Flexible working arrangements
- Growth opportunities

### Using Referral Codes

Share your unique referral code to recruit tutors:

1. Go to **Referrals** dashboard
2. Copy your unique referral link
3. Share with potential tutors
4. Track sign-ups in real-time

**Your referral link:**
```
https://tutorwise.com/signup?ref=YOUR_CODE
```

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Commission Structure**: Earn 3% commission on all bookings in your network for the first 12 months of each tutor's activity.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 4: Recruit Students

### Finding Students

**Best Channels:**
- Local schools and parent groups
- Community centers and libraries
- Social media advertising
- Educational events and fairs
- Word-of-mouth referrals

### Marketing Your Services

**Effective Messaging:**
- Highlight your vetted tutor network
- Emphasize personalized matching
- Show success stories and testimonials
- Offer free consultations
- Demonstrate value and results

## Step 5: Set Up Referral Delegation

Supercharge your growth by delegating commissions to sub-agents:

### How Delegation Works

1. Find trusted partners who can recruit on your behalf
2. Delegate a percentage of your commission (10-50%)
3. They promote your network using your referral code
4. Commissions split automatically
5. Both parties earn from network growth

### Setting Up Delegation

1. Go to **Referrals** → **Delegation**
2. Search for agent by their referral code
3. Set delegation percentage
4. Confirm delegation agreement
5. Monitor delegated performance

**Example:**
- You earn 3% on network bookings
- Delegate 40% to a sub-agent
- Sub-agent earns 1.2% (40% of 3%)
- You still earn 1.8%
- Faster network growth benefits everyone

## Step 6: Manage Your Network

### Organization Dashboard

Access powerful tools to manage your network:

**Key Metrics:**
- Total tutors in network
- Active bookings this month
- Commission earnings (pending and paid)
- Student satisfaction ratings
- Tutor performance analytics

**Network Management:**
- Tutor onboarding status
- Booking activity by tutor
- Student feedback and reviews
- Payment processing status
- Growth trends and forecasts

### Supporting Your Tutors

**Best Practices:**
- Regular check-ins and feedback sessions
- Training on platform features
- Help with marketing and student acquisition
- Quick response to questions and issues
- Recognition for top performers

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Success Tip**: The most successful agents treat their tutors as partners, not just referrals. Invest in their success and they'll invest in yours.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 7: Track Your Earnings
