## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't I message someone?**
A: You can only message:
- Your network connections
- People you've had bookings with
- Organisation members
- People who messaged you first

**Q: My messages aren't sending. Why?**
A: Check:
- Internet connection
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari recommended)
- Message isn't too long (5,000 character limit)
- File size under 10 MB

**Q: Can I delete a sent message?**
A: Not currently. Messages are permanent once sent. Double-check before sending!

**Q: How do I know if someone read my message?**
A: Look for read receipts:
- Single checkmark: Delivered
- Double checkmark: Read
- Gray: Not delivered yet

**Q: Can I message multiple people at once (group chat)?**
A: Not currently. Group messaging is coming soon! For now, use organisation features for team communication.

**Q: Are my messages private?**
A: Yes, end-to-end encrypted. Only you and the recipient can read them. Tutorwise staff only access messages for reported violations.
