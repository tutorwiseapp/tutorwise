Take your Agent business to the next level. This guide covers advanced strategies for building a profitable tutor network, optimizing commission earnings, and scaling your referral business on Tutorwise.

**New to Being an Agent?** Start with our [For Agents Guide](/help-centre/getting-started/for-agents) to learn the basics first.
</CalloutBox>

## Understanding the Agent Business Model

### Your Revenue Streams

**Primary Income:**
- **10% commission** on every session your referred tutors complete
- **Wiselist attribution tracking** for bookings from your shared lists
- **Ongoing passive income** from active tutor network
- **No cap** on total earnings

**Example Monthly Earnings:**
```
10 Active Tutors × £2,000/month each = £20,000 total
Your Commission (10%): £2,000/month

Future: Wiselist commissions (coming 2026)
Potential Total: £2,200+/month
```

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Scale Potential:** Top agents earn £5,000+ per month by building networks of 25+ active tutors. Your income grows with your network!
</CalloutBox>

### Commission Structure Explained

**How Commission Works:**
- Calculated on tutor's **net earnings** (after platform fee)
- Paid weekly with your regular payouts
- Tracks automatically - no manual invoicing
- Transparent in [Financials Dashboard](/financials)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Student pays: £100 for 2-hour session
Platform fee (10%): -£10
Tutor's net earnings: £90
Your commission (10% of £90): £9.00
```

**Commission Timeline:**
1. Session completes → Earnings process
2. 7-day clearing period (new tutors) or 3 days (established)
3. Commission added to your available balance
4. Weekly Friday payout to your bank account

## Building Your Agent Credibility Score

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Agent CaaS is Live!** As an agent, you now have your own credibility score that reflects your recruitment quality and business operations.
</CalloutBox>

### Why Agent CaaS Matters

Your Agent Credibility Score (CaaS) is a 0-100 rating that shows:
- **To Tutors**: You're a trustworthy, professional agent worth joining
- **To Clients**: Your network consists of quality, verified educators
- **To the Platform**: You run a legitimate, high-performing agency

**Benefits of High Agent CaaS (70+):**
- Easier tutor recruitment (tutors trust high-CaaS agents)
- Higher conversion on referrals
- Featured placement as "Verified Agent"
- Access to premium agent benefits
- Enhanced credibility for your organisation

### The 4-Bucket Agent Scoring Model

Your Agent CaaS is calculated across four weighted categories:

**1. Recruitment Performance (40 points)**
- **Recruited Tutor Quality**: Average CaaS score of tutors you've recruited
  - One excellent tutor (CaaS 85+) > five poor tutors (CaaS 40)
  - Minimum 3 recruited tutors required for scoring
- **Active Tutor Rate**: Percentage of your recruits actively teaching
  - Shows you recruit sustainable, engaged tutors (not churners)
  - Rewards long-term tutor retention and support

**2. Business Growth (30 points)**
- **Sessions Facilitated**: Total sessions completed by your network
  - Progressive scoring: 10 sessions = 10pts, 50+ = 20pts
  - Demonstrates real business impact
- **Revenue Generated**: Total booking value from your tutors
  - Scaled scoring based on volume
  - Shows commercial viability and success

**3. Professional Operations (20 points)**
- **Subscription Tier**: Active Organisation Premium subscription (+10pts)
  - Shows professional commitment beyond casual referrals
- **Organisation Verification**: Business verified, professional credentials
  - Demonstrates legitimacy and trustworthiness

**4. Platform Engagement (10 points)**
- **Active Recruitment**: Recent tutor recruitment activity
  - Engaged vs. dormant agents
- **Response Rate**: Speed of responding to tutor inquiries
  - Professional communication and support

### Agent vs Organisation CaaS

**Important Distinction:** If you own an organisation, you have **TWO separate credibility scores**:

| Aspect | Your Agent CaaS | Your Organisation CaaS |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Measures** | Your recruitment expertise | Your team's performance |
| **Scored As** | Individual profile | Entity (organisation) |
| **Key Factors** | Tutor quality, business ops | Team average, verifications |
| **Storage** | `caas_scores` table | `connection_groups.caas_score` |
| **Visible On** | Your personal profile | Organisation page |
| **Benefits** | Tutor recruitment credibility | Client trust, team reputation |

Both scores matter:
- **Agent CaaS**: Helps recruit new tutors ("This agent knows what they're doing")
- **Organisation CaaS**: Helps win clients ("This team delivers quality")

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Pro Strategy:** A high Agent CaaS (recruitment expertise) attracts quality tutors, which boosts your Organisation CaaS (team performance), creating a virtuous growth cycle.
</CalloutBox>

## Troubleshooting & Common Challenges

**Q: My tutors aren't getting bookings. What should I do?**
A: Audit their profiles:
- Is CaaS score 60+? (Help them improve)
- Competitive pricing? (Research market rates)
- Complete profile? (90%+ completion)
- Good availability? (20+ hours/week)
- Professional photo? (First impression matters)
Coach them to improve these areas.

**Q: How do I keep tutors motivated when bookings are slow?**
A: Provide proactive support:
- Share booking strategies
- Feature them in your wiselists
- Offer temporary price promotions
- Connect them with other agents/tutors
- Celebrate small wins

**Q: What's a realistic income goal for my first year?**
A: Conservative estimate:
- Month 1-3: £0-200 (building network)
- Month 4-6: £200-500 (tutors gaining traction)
- Month 7-12: £500-1500 (momentum building)
- Year 1 Total: ~£6,000-10,000

Ambitious but achievable: £15,000-25,000 first year with focused effort.

**Q: Should I specialize in one subject or go broad?**
A: Start narrow, expand later:
- Easier to build reputation in niche
- Become known as "the Maths tutor agent"
- Once established (20+ tutors), diversify
- Balanced approach reduces risk long-term

**Q: How do I handle tutor conflicts or complaints?**
A: Act as mediator but defer to platform:
- Listen to concerns empathetically
- Provide guidance and support
- Direct serious issues to Tutorwise support
- You're not responsible for resolving disputes
- Focus on maintaining relationships

**Q: Can I be an agent AND a tutor simultaneously?**
A: Absolutely! Many successful agents:
- Tutor 10-15 hours/week themselves
- Earn from own sessions + commission
- Understand platform from both perspectives
- Build credibility with referred tutors
- Diversified income streams
