## What Are Connections?

Connections are bidirectional professional relationships on Tutorwise. When you connect with someone:

- **See Their Updates** - Activity feed shows connection bookings and milestones
- **Message Directly** - Send messages through the platform
- **Share Opportunities** - Refer clients to connected tutors
- **Build Trust** - Visible connections signal credibility
- **Collaborate** - Work together on projects or organisations

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Platform Impact:** Users with 10+ connections return 3x more frequently and book 45% more sessions!
</CalloutBox>

## How to Connect with Others

### Sending Connection Requests

**Step 1: Find Someone to Connect With**

You can find potential connections through:

1. **Search Results** - Browse marketplace and click profiles
2. **Booking Sessions** - Connect with your tutor/client after sessions
3. **Organisation Members** - Connect with your team
4. **Mutual Connections** - See who your connections know

**Step 3: Send Request**

1. Click **"Connect"** button on their profile

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Personalization Matters:** Requests with messages get accepted 65% more often than generic requests!

**Good Message Example:**
> "Hi Sarah! I saw you teach GCSE Maths. I specialize in A-Level Maths and would love to connect for potential student referrals."
</CalloutBox>

**Step 4: Wait for Response**

- Recipient receives email notification immediately
- They have unlimited time to respond

- Request shows as "Pending" in your network

### Accepting or Declining Requests

**When You Receive a Request:**

**Email Notification:**
- Instant email with requester's name and message
- Direct link to accept/decline
- Option to view full profile first

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't I send a connection request to someone?**
A: Possible reasons:
- You already have a pending request
- They've blocked you
- They've reached max connections (unlikely)
- Technical issue (try refreshing)

**Q: Someone declined my request. Can I try again?**
A: Yes, but wait at least 30 days and have a good reason. Repeated requests after declines may be considered harassment.

**Q: How do I know if someone declined my request?**
A: Pending requests disappear after 30 days if not accepted. No notification is sent for declines (privacy courtesy).

**Q: Can I hide specific connections from my public profile?**
A: Not currently. All connections are visible to promote transparency and trust.

**Q: Do connections expire?**
A: No, connections remain active indefinitely unless removed by either party.

**Q: Can organisations force connections between members?**
A: No, all connections require mutual consent. Organisations can suggest connections but cannot force them.
