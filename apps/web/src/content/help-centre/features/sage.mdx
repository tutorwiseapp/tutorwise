## What Is Sage?

Sage is Tutorwise's built-in AI tutor — a conversational learning assistant that helps you understand concepts, solve problems, and practise for exams. It's available 24/7 from your dashboard at no extra cost.

- **Explains** topics step-by-step with examples
- **Solves** equations, grammar exercises, and science problems with working
- **Generates** practice questions tailored to your curriculum level
- **Remembers** your uploaded materials and references them in answers
- **Tracks** your learning progress over time

### Who Is Sage For?

| Role | How Sage Helps |
|------|---------------|
| **Students** | Homework help, concept explanations, exam revision, practice exercises |
| **Tutors** | Lesson planning, worksheet generation, teaching strategy ideas |
| **Parents** | Understanding your child's curriculum, learning support tips |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Sage vs Lexi:** Sage is your **academic tutor** — it teaches Maths, English, and Science. [Lexi](/help-centre/features/lexi) is your **platform assistant** — it helps with bookings, payments, referrals, and navigating Tutorwise. If you ask Lexi an academic question, it will suggest Sage automatically.

## Features in Detail

### Streaming Responses

Sage streams responses in real time — you see words appear as they're generated, just like a real conversation. This means you don't have to wait for the full answer before reading.

### Maths & Formula Rendering

Sage renders mathematical notation using LaTeX, so equations display properly:

- **Inline maths:** Expressions like x² + 2x + 1 appear naturally within text
- **Display maths:** Complex equations and working appear on their own lines
- **Symbols:** Greek letters (π, θ, Σ), fractions, square roots, integrals — all rendered correctly

### Suggestion Chips

After each response, Sage shows **contextual suggestions** — quick actions you can tap to continue learning:

- "Explain further" — get a deeper explanation
- "Give me a practice question" — test your understanding
- "Show me another example" — see a different approach
- "Simplify this" — get an easier explanation

### Message Feedback

Every Sage response has **thumbs up/down buttons**. Your feedback helps improve future responses — tap the thumbs to let us know when an explanation was particularly helpful or could be better.

## Upload Your Materials

Sage can reference **your own study materials** when answering questions. Upload class notes, textbook pages, or worksheets and Sage will search them for relevant context.

### How to Upload

1. Go to [Sage Materials](/sage/materials)
2. Click **Upload Material** or drag and drop files
3. Select the **subject** and **level** for the material
4. Wait for processing (usually a few seconds)
5. Once status shows **Ready**, Sage can reference it in conversations

### Supported File Types

| Format | Max Size | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| PDF (.pdf) | 25 MB | Textbooks, worksheets, past papers |
| PowerPoint (.pptx) | 50 MB | Lecture slides, class presentations |
| Word (.docx) | 25 MB | Notes, essays, handouts |
| Text (.txt, .md) | 5 MB | Plain text notes |

### How It Works Behind the Scenes

When you upload a file:
1. The document is split into smaller sections (chunks)
2. Each section is converted into a searchable format
3. When you ask a question, Sage searches your materials for relevant sections
4. Matching content is included as context in Sage's response

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Your materials are private.** Uploaded files are only accessible to you — other users cannot see or search your materials.
</CalloutBox>

## How Sage Adapts to Your Role

    **Focus Areas:**
    - Step-by-step explanations at your level
    - Practice exercises and quiz generation
    - Homework help with working shown
    - Exam revision strategies
    - Encouraging tone with positive reinforcement
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Tutors">
    **Greeting:** "Hello! I'm Sage, here to help prepare great lessons."

    **Focus Areas:**
    - Lesson planning and content ideas
    - Worksheet and assessment generation
    - Teaching strategies for difficult topics

</Tabs>

## Sage Navigation

Sage has four pages accessible from the sidebar:

| Page | Route | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Chat** | [/sage](/sage) | Main tutoring interface — ask questions, get explanations |
| **History** | [/sage/history](/sage/history) | Review past sessions and conversations |
| **Progress** | [/sage/progress](/sage/progress) | View learning statistics and streaks |
| **Materials** | [/sage/materials](/sage/materials) | Upload and manage study materials |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific.** "Explain quadratic equations" works better than "help with maths"
2. **Include your level.** "I'm studying for GCSE" helps Sage pitch the explanation correctly
3. **Ask for steps.** "Solve step by step" gives you the working, not just the answer
4. **Upload materials.** Your class notes and textbook pages make Sage's answers more relevant
5. **Use follow-ups.** Ask "explain further" or "give me another example" to deepen understanding
6. **Try practice mode.** Ask Sage to "test me on..." for active recall practice

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Sage isn't answering my question. What should I do?**
A: Try rephrasing your question. Be specific about the topic and level. If the issue persists, check your internet connection and try refreshing the page.

**Q: My uploaded material shows "Processing". How long does it take?**
A: Most files process within 30 seconds. Large PowerPoint files may take up to 2 minutes. If status remains "Processing" for more than 5 minutes, try re-uploading.

**Q: Can Sage help with subjects other than Maths, English, and Science?**
A: Currently Sage specialises in Maths, English, and Science. For other subjects, select "General" mode — Sage can still help with study skills, essay structure, and revision techniques. More subjects are being added.

**Q: Why does Sage sometimes give different answers to the same question?**
A: AI responses can vary slightly between sessions. If you need a specific format, include it in your question (e.g. "explain in bullet points" or "show the working step by step").

**Q: Is my conversation history saved?**
A: Yes. All conversations are saved and accessible from [Sage History](/sage/history). Sessions expire after 24 hours, but completed conversations remain in your history.

**Q: How does Sage differ from a real tutor?**
A: Sage provides instant, always-available help for concept explanations and practice. For personalised learning plans, accountability, and deeper mentoring, we recommend booking sessions with a [tutor on the Marketplace](/marketplace).

**Q: Can my tutor see my Sage conversations?**
A: No. Your Sage conversations are private to you.
