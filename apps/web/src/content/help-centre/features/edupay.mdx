<CalloutBox type="success">
**The smart choice depends on your situation.** EduPay shows you when to pay directly vs when to grow your money first — genuine guidance, not blind encouragement.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Quick Access:** Go to [Financials → EduPay](/financials/edupay) to view your EP wallet and make smart choices with your earnings.
</CalloutBox>

## Why EduPay?

Most apps just tell you to "pay faster." EduPay is different — we help you **pay smarter**.

**The problem:** 75% of Plan 2 borrowers won't fully repay their loans before write-off. For them, overpaying is mathematically irrational. You deserve better advice than "just pay more."

**The EduPay solution:** Three paths, tailored to your situation:

| Path | Best For | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Student Loan** | Plan 1, high earners (£50k+) | You'll repay in full — reduce interest now |
| **ISA** | Plan 2/5, lower earners | Won't repay anyway — grow tax-free instead |
| **Savings** | Uncertain income | Stay flexible, earn interest, decide later |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Your skills. Your choices. Your progress.** Every EP you earn is yours to direct — EduPay helps you make the smart choice for *your* situation.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is EduPay?

EduPay is a financial decision layer built into Tutorwise. It is **not** a bank — it's a system that:

- Awards EP for activity you're already doing (tutoring, referrals, rewards)
- Helps you **choose the optimal path** for your situation
- Shows you exactly how your decisions affect your financial future

### The Points Model

```
£1 of value received = 100 EduPay Points (EP)
100 EP = £1 of financial impact
```

EP represents value you've already earned. When you convert EP, you're directing money that's already yours to the destination that makes sense for you.

## How You Earn EP

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tutoring Sessions">
    **Earn EP from every session you teach.**

    When a student pays for a session:
    - Tutorwise processes the payment via Stripe
    - 10% platform fee is deducted
    - Your 90% earnings are converted to EP automatically

    **Example:**
    ```
    Student pays £100 for session
    Platform fee (10%): -£10
    Your earnings: £90
    EP awarded: 9,000 EP (£90 × 100)
    ```

    Your EP accumulates in your wallet as you teach. The more sessions you complete, the more EP you earn.
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Referral Bonuses">
    **Earn EP when people you referred complete sessions.**

    When a user you referred books a session:
    - Your 10% lifetime referral commission is awarded
    - Commission is converted to EP automatically

    **Example:**
    ```
    Referred tutor earns £90 from a session
    Your commission (10%): £9.00
    EP awarded: 1,350 EP (referral rate)
    ```

    Referral commissions run for the **lifetime** of the user you referred — every future booking earns you EP.

    See [Referrals Guide](/help-centre/features/referrals) for details on building your referral network.
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Affiliate Rewards">
    **Earn EP when you shop via Tutorwise affiliate links.**

    When you shop through partner links (coming soon — we're onboarding partners now):
    - Merchant pays Tutorwise a commission
    - 90% of that commission is awarded to you as EP

    **Example:**
    ```
    You spend £100 at a partner store
    Merchant commission (6%): £6.00 to Tutorwise
    Your EP reward (90%): £5.40 → 540 EP
    ```

    Affiliate partners will include educational retailers, stationery suppliers, and study tool providers. More partners are being added — your EP wallet is already set up to receive rewards the moment they go live.

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    Affiliate rewards are coming soon. Your wallet is ready — you'll start earning automatically once our first partners go live. No action needed from you.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="CaaS Rewards">
    **Earn bonus EP by maintaining a high Credibility Score.**

    The CaaS (Credibility as a Service) system rewards tutors who consistently deliver quality sessions:
    - Reach CaaS threshold milestones to unlock bonus EP
    - Bonus EP is added directly to your wallet
    - Higher CaaS score = more bonus opportunities

    See [CaaS Guide](/help-centre/features/caas) to understand how to improve your credibility score.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Your EP Wallet

The **EduPay Wallet** widget in your sidebar shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| EP Balance | Your available EP ready to convert |
| GBP Value | Current EP converted to pounds (EP ÷ 100) |
| Pending EP | EP from recent sessions still clearing (7-day period) |
| Total Converted | Total EP you've already directed to your loan |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**EP Status Flow:** Pending → Available → Converted

EP becomes **available** after the 7-day clearing period. Available EP can be directed to your student loan.
</CalloutBox>

## EP Activity Feed

Your EP activity feed shows every EP event in chronological order. Each entry shows:

- **Type badge** (Earned, Converted, Bonus, Expired)
- **Description** — what triggered the EP award
- **EP amount** — how many EP were awarded
- **GBP equivalent** — the pound value
- **Status** — Pending / Available / Converted
- **Date** and availability date (for pending entries)

### Filtering Your Activity

Use the header filters to find specific EP events:

- **Search** — find activity by description or event type
- **Date range** — Last 30 Days / Last 3 Months / Last Year / All Time
- **Activity type** — Tutoring / Referral / Affiliate / Gift Reward / CaaS Reward

### Activity Tabs

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| All Activity | Complete EP history |
| Pending | EP clearing (7-day wait) |
| Available | EP ready to convert |
| Converted | EP already directed to your loan |

## Loan Impact Projection

Set up your **Loan Profile** to unlock personalised projections — and see which path makes the most sense for **your** situation.

The **Loan Impact** widget shows:
- Years earlier you'll be debt-free (if you pay directly)
- Total interest saved (projected)
- Whether ISA/Savings might be smarter for you

### Setting Up Your Loan Profile

If you haven't set up a loan profile yet, you'll see a **"Set Up Loan Profile"** button on the EduPay page.

**You'll need:**
1. Your loan plan type (Plan 1, Plan 2, Plan 5, or Postgraduate)
2. Estimated current loan balance (£)
3. Your annual salary (used for projection calculations)
4. Your graduation year

Once saved, your projection updates automatically as you earn more EP.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Edit your loan profile** at any time via the **⋮** menu in the top-right of the EduPay page → "Edit Loan Profile".
</CalloutBox>

### UK Student Loan Plans

| Plan | Who It's For |
|------|-------------|
| Plan 1 | Started before September 2012 (England/Wales) or before August 2023 (Scotland/NI) |
| Plan 2 | Started between 2012–2023 (England/Wales) |
| Plan 5 | Started September 2023 or later (England) |
| Postgraduate | Masters/PhD loans |

## Converting EP — The Smart Choice

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Three paths, one smart choice.** Click **"Convert EP"** on the EduPay page to direct your available EP to the destination that makes sense for your situation.
</CalloutBox>

### Your Three Options

| Destination | What Happens | Best For |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Student Loan** | Paid directly to SLC via Open Banking | Plan 1, high earners who'll repay in full |
| **ISA** | Allocated to your tax-free ISA (up to 5.1% APY) | Plan 2/5, those who may not repay anyway |
| **Savings** | Transferred to savings account (up to 4.6% APY) | Anyone who wants flexibility first |

### Conversion Flow

1. Click **"Convert EP"** in the EduPay header
2. Enter how much EP to convert (up to your available balance)
3. **Choose your smart path** — Student Loan, ISA, or Savings
4. Review your conversion details and projected outcome
5. Confirm — for Student Loan, you'll authorise via your bank

**Conversion rate:** 100 EP = £1.00 (no fees, no minimum)

### Student Loan Payments

For Student Loan conversions:
- You'll be redirected to your bank via Open Banking (powered by TrueLayer)
- Authorise the payment securely — Tutorwise never holds your money
- The payment goes directly to your Student Loans Company account
- Set up your **Loan Profile** first to add your SLC payment reference

### ISA & Savings Accounts

For ISA or Savings conversions:
- Link a provider (e.g., Trading 212 ISA, Chase Saver, Moneybox)
- See projected interest before you confirm
- Funds are allocated instantly (simulated during beta)
- Track your savings and projected interest in the EduPay dashboard

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**When growing makes sense:** If you're unlikely to repay your loan in full (most Plan 2 borrowers won't), putting money in an ISA at 5.1% APY is often smarter than overpaying. EduPay shows you the math so you can make an informed choice.
</CalloutBox>

## Savings & ISA Widget

If you've allocated EP to ISA or Savings accounts, the **Savings & ISA** widget appears in your sidebar showing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Allocated | Total GBP allocated to savings/ISA accounts |
| Projected Interest | Estimated interest earnings (12 months) |
| Total Value | Allocated amount + projected interest |
| Accounts | Number of linked savings/ISA accounts |

## EP Status Explained

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | EP awarded but in the 7-day clearing period |
| **Available** | EP cleared and ready to convert |
| **Converted** | EP directed to your student loan |
| **Expired** | EP that expired before conversion (rare) |

<CalloutBox type="warning">
EP earned from sessions follows the same 7-day clearing period as your financial earnings. This protects against refunds and chargebacks.
</CalloutBox>

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why is my EP showing as "Pending"?**
A: EP from sessions takes 7 days to clear (same as financial earnings). Once cleared, it moves to "Available" status automatically.

**Q: My session completed but I didn't receive EP. Why?**
A: EP is awarded once the payment clears. Check if the transaction is still processing in your [Financials](/financials) page. If the transaction shows as "Cleared" but EP hasn't arrived within 24 hours, contact support.

**Q: How do I see my loan impact projection?**
A: Set up your Loan Profile first. Click the **"Set Up Loan Profile"** button on the EduPay page, or use the **⋮** menu → "Edit Loan Profile" if you've already set one up.

**Q: Can I transfer EP to another user?**
A: EP is non-transferable. It's tied to the activity you personally generated on the platform.

**Q: Does EP expire?**
A: EP does not expire during the accumulation phase. If expiry rules are introduced in a future update, you will be notified in advance.

**Q: Where is the "Convert EP" feature?**
A: The "Convert EP" button is available in the header of the EduPay page. Click it to start the conversion flow.

**Q: What's the difference between ISA, Savings, and Student Loan destinations?**
A: **Student Loan** pays directly to SLC via Open Banking. **ISA** and **Savings** allocate your funds to linked accounts where you can earn interest (up to 5.1% APY) before eventually paying your loan. Choose ISA/Savings if you want to grow your money first.

**Q: How do I link an ISA or Savings account?**
A: In the conversion modal, select ISA or Savings as your destination, then click "Link an ISA" or "Link a Savings Account". Choose a provider from the list — we support Trading 212, Chase, Moneybox, Plum, and more.

**Q: Can I withdraw from my ISA/Savings to pay my loan later?**
A: Yes. Funds allocated to ISA/Savings can be withdrawn at any time to make a Student Loan payment. This feature is coming soon — for now, your allocations are tracked in the Savings & ISA widget.

**Q: Why can't I select ISA or Savings?**
A: ISA and Savings destinations require you to link a provider first. If you see "Coming Soon" on these options, the feature may still be rolling out to your account.
