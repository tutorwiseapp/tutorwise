# EduPay — Turn Your Tutoring Into Loan Payments

EduPay converts your tutoring activity into real financial impact on your student loan. Every session you teach, every friend you refer, and every affiliated purchase you make earns you EduPay Points (EP) — which reduce your student loan balance.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Quick Access:** Go to [Financials → EduPay](/financials/edupay) to view your EP wallet and activity.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="success">
**EduPay is free to use.** You earn EP automatically from activity you're already doing on Tutorwise. No extra steps required.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is EduPay?

EduPay is a financial rewards layer built on top of Tutorwise. It is **not** a bank or payment processor — it is a points-based system that:

- Awards EP for activity that already happens on Tutorwise (sessions, referrals, rewards)
- Converts EP into measurable financial progress against your student loan
- Shows you exactly how many years earlier you'll be debt-free

### The Points Model

```
£1 of value received = 100 EduPay Points (EP)
100 EP = £1 of financial impact on your loan
```

EP represents value you've already earned. When you convert EP, you're directing money that's already yours — not receiving new money from Tutorwise.

## How You Earn EP

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tutoring Sessions">
    **Earn EP from every session you teach.**

    When a student pays for a session:
    - Tutorwise processes the payment via Stripe
    - 10% platform fee is deducted
    - Your 90% earnings are converted to EP automatically

    **Example:**
    ```
    Student pays £100 for session
    Platform fee (10%): -£10
    Your earnings: £90
    EP awarded: 9,000 EP (£90 × 100)
    ```

    Your EP accumulates in your wallet as you teach. The more sessions you complete, the more EP you earn.
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Referral Bonuses">
    **Earn EP when people you referred complete sessions.**

    When a user you referred books a session:
    - Your 10% lifetime referral commission is awarded
    - Commission is converted to EP automatically

    **Example:**
    ```
    Referred tutor earns £90 from a session
    Your commission (10%): £9.00
    EP awarded: 1,350 EP (referral rate)
    ```

    Referral commissions run for the **lifetime** of the user you referred — every future booking earns you EP.

    See [Referrals Guide](/help-centre/features/referrals) for details on building your referral network.
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Affiliate Rewards">
    **Earn EP when you shop via Tutorwise affiliate links.**

    When you shop through partner links (coming soon — we're onboarding partners now):
    - Merchant pays Tutorwise a commission
    - 90% of that commission is awarded to you as EP

    **Example:**
    ```
    You spend £100 at a partner store
    Merchant commission (6%): £6.00 to Tutorwise
    Your EP reward (90%): £5.40 → 540 EP
    ```

    Affiliate partners will include educational retailers, stationery suppliers, and study tool providers. More partners are being added — your EP wallet is already set up to receive rewards the moment they go live.

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    Affiliate rewards are coming soon. Your wallet is ready — you'll start earning automatically once our first partners go live. No action needed from you.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="CaaS Rewards">
    **Earn bonus EP by maintaining a high Credibility Score.**

    The CaaS (Credibility as a Service) system rewards tutors who consistently deliver quality sessions:
    - Reach CaaS threshold milestones to unlock bonus EP
    - Bonus EP is added directly to your wallet
    - Higher CaaS score = more bonus opportunities

    See [CaaS Guide](/help-centre/features/caas) to understand how to improve your credibility score.

## Your EP Wallet

The **EduPay Wallet** widget in your sidebar shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| EP Balance | Your available EP ready to convert |
| GBP Value | Current EP converted to pounds (EP ÷ 100) |
| Pending EP | EP from recent sessions still clearing (7-day period) |
| Total Converted | Total EP you've already directed to your loan |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**EP Status Flow:** Pending → Available → Converted

EP becomes **available** after the 7-day clearing period. Available EP can be directed to your student loan.
</CalloutBox>

---

## EP Activity Feed

Your EP activity feed shows every EP event in chronological order. Each entry shows:

- **Type badge** (Earned, Converted, Bonus, Expired)
- **Description** — what triggered the EP award
- **EP amount** — how many EP were awarded
- **GBP equivalent** — the pound value
- **Status** — Pending / Available / Converted
- **Date** and availability date (for pending entries)

### Filtering Your Activity

Use the header filters to find specific EP events:

- **Search** — find activity by description or event type
- **Date range** — Last 30 Days / Last 3 Months / Last Year / All Time
- **Activity type** — Tutoring / Referral / Affiliate / Gift Reward / CaaS Reward

### Activity Tabs

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| All Activity | Complete EP history |
| Pending | EP clearing (7-day wait) |
| Available | EP ready to convert |
| Converted | EP already directed to your loan |

## Loan Impact Projection

Set up your **Loan Profile** to unlock personalised projections showing exactly how your EP affects your student loan.

The **Loan Impact** widget shows:
- Years earlier you'll be debt-free
- Total interest saved (projected)

### Setting Up Your Loan Profile

If you haven't set up a loan profile yet, you'll see a **"Set Up Loan Profile"** button on the EduPay page.

**You'll need:**
1. Your loan plan type (Plan 1, Plan 2, Plan 5, or Postgraduate)
2. Estimated current loan balance (£)
3. Your annual salary (used for projection calculations)
4. Your graduation year

Once saved, your projection updates automatically as you earn more EP.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Edit your loan profile** at any time via the **⋮** menu in the top-right of the EduPay page → "Edit Loan Profile".
</CalloutBox>

### UK Student Loan Plans

| Plan | Who It's For |
|------|-------------|
| Plan 1 | Started before September 2012 (England/Wales) or before August 2023 (Scotland/NI) |
| Plan 2 | Started between 2012–2023 (England/Wales) |
| Plan 5 | Started September 2023 or later (England) |
| Postgraduate | Masters/PhD loans |

## Converting EP (Coming Soon)

<CalloutBox type="info">
**EP conversion to loan payments is coming.** Your EP is accumulating now — keep earning and it will be ready to convert when the feature launches.
</CalloutBox>

When conversion launches, you'll be able to direct your EP straight to your student loan:

1. Click **"Convert EP"** in the EduPay header
2. Choose how much EP to convert (up to your available balance)
3. Select destination: **Student Loan**, ISA, or Savings
4. Confirm — you'll be taken through a quick bank authorisation step (powered by TrueLayer Open Banking)
5. The equivalent GBP value is sent directly to your Student Loans Company account

**Conversion rate:** 100 EP = £1.00 (no conversion fees, no minimum)

**Why bank authorisation?** We use Open Banking (TrueLayer) to initiate the payment directly from your bank to SLC — this means Tutorwise never holds your money. The payment goes straight to your loan account, fully traceable.

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Start earning now.** The conversion feature is being built in parallel with partner onboarding. Every EP you earn today will be convertible when it launches — nothing is lost.
</CalloutBox>

## EP Status Explained

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | EP awarded but in the 7-day clearing period |
| **Available** | EP cleared and ready to convert |
| **Converted** | EP directed to your student loan |
| **Expired** | EP that expired before conversion (rare) |

<CalloutBox type="warning">
EP earned from sessions follows the same 7-day clearing period as your financial earnings. This protects against refunds and chargebacks.
</CalloutBox>

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why is my EP showing as "Pending"?**
A: EP from sessions takes 7 days to clear (same as financial earnings). Once cleared, it moves to "Available" status automatically.

**Q: My session completed but I didn't receive EP. Why?**
A: EP is awarded once the payment clears. Check if the transaction is still processing in your [Financials](/financials) page. If the transaction shows as "Cleared" but EP hasn't arrived within 24 hours, contact support.

**Q: How do I see my loan impact projection?**
A: Set up your Loan Profile first. Click the **"Set Up Loan Profile"** button on the EduPay page, or use the **⋮** menu → "Edit Loan Profile" if you've already set one up.

**Q: Can I transfer EP to another user?**
A: EP is non-transferable. It's tied to the activity you personally generated on the platform.

**Q: Does EP expire?**
A: EP expiry rules will be published when Phase 3 (conversion) launches. During Phase 1 (accumulation), your EP does not expire.

**Q: Where is the "Convert EP" feature?**
A: EP conversion is coming soon. It requires TrueLayer Open Banking integration so payments go directly to your Student Loans Company account. Your balance is accumulating now — every EP you earn will be convertible when it launches.
