## What Is Lexi?

Lexi is Tutorwise's built-in AI assistant — a conversational guide that helps you understand and use every feature on the platform. Unlike a generic chatbot, Lexi knows the entire Tutorwise platform and adjusts its personality, tone, and suggestions based on your role.

- **Answers** questions about any platform feature instantly
- **Guides** you through bookings, payments, referrals, and settings
- **Suggests** relevant next actions based on your current page
- **Adapts** to your role (student, tutor, client, agent, organisation)
- **Hands off** to Sage when you need academic help

### Lexi vs Sage

| | Lexi | Sage |
|---|------|------|
| **Purpose** | Platform assistant | Academic tutor |
| **Helps with** | Bookings, payments, referrals, settings, navigation | Maths, English, Science, homework, revision |
| **Tone** | Role-appropriate (supportive, professional, friendly) | Educational (step-by-step, encouraging) |
| **Access** | Floating button on every page | Dedicated section at [/sage](/sage) |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Academic question?** If you ask Lexi about homework, equations, or grammar, it will suggest switching to [Sage](/sage) — your dedicated AI tutor with full curriculum support.
</CalloutBox>

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Where is the "Ask Lexi" button?**
A: Look for the floating button in the bottom-right corner of any page. It shows a sparkle icon with "Ask Lexi" text.

**Q: Lexi says "Session expired". What do I do?**
A: Sessions last 24 hours. Close the chat window and reopen it — a new session starts automatically.

**Q: Lexi gave me a wrong answer. What should I do?**
A: Tap the **thumbs down** button on the response and rephrase your question with more detail. Lexi's knowledge is comprehensive but it may need more context for specific queries.

**Q: Can Lexi help with Maths or Science homework?**
A: For academic questions, Lexi will suggest switching to [Sage](/sage) — our dedicated AI tutor with subject-specific knowledge, curriculum alignment, and LaTeX formula rendering.

**Q: Does Lexi remember my previous conversations?**
A: Lexi remembers messages within the current session (24 hours). You can view past conversations in the **History** tab, but starting a new session begins a fresh context.

**Q: Can Lexi perform actions on my account?**
A: Lexi provides guidance and directs you to the right page, but cannot directly modify your account, process payments, or change settings. It will give you the exact steps and links.

**Q: Is my conversation with Lexi private?**
A: Yes. Your conversations are associated with your account and not shared with other users, tutors, or clients.

**Q: Lexi doesn't understand my question. Any tips?**
A: Use specific keywords. Instead of "how do I invite people", try "where is my referral link" or "how do referral commissions work". Lexi matches on key terms to detect your intent.
