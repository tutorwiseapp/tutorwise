# How Bookings Work

Bookings are the core of Tutorwise. Whether you're a student looking for tutoring or a tutor offering sessions, understanding the booking system helps you get the most out of the platform.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Quick Start**: Students book → Tutors accept → Sessions happen → Payments process automatically.
</CalloutBox>

## For Students: Booking a Session

### Step 3: Request a Booking
