# How Bookings Work

Bookings are the core of Tutorwise. Whether you're a student looking for tutoring or a tutor offering sessions, understanding the booking system helps you get the most out of the platform.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Quick Start**: Students book → Tutors accept → Sessions happen → Payments process automatically.
</CalloutBox>

## For Students: Booking a Session

### Step 1: Find a Tutor

Browse the [Marketplace](/marketplace) to find tutors by:
- Subject and level
- Price range
- Availability
- Location (online or in-person)
- Reviews and ratings

### Step 2: View Available Times

Click on a tutor's profile to see:
- Their calendar with available time slots
- Session duration options (30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours)
- Hourly rate
- Session type (online/in-person)

### Step 3: Request a Booking

1. Select your preferred time slot
2. Choose session duration
3. Add session details:
   - Subject or topic to cover
   - Any specific materials or homework
   - Learning goals for the session
4. Add payment method (required)
5. Confirm booking request

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Tip**: Be specific about your learning goals. This helps tutors prepare better materials for your session.
</CalloutBox>

### Step 4: Scheduling Flow

Once your booking is created, the scheduling process begins:

**Scheduling Status:**
1. **Unscheduled** - Booking created, no time set yet
2. **Proposed** - One party has suggested a time (15-minute slot hold)
3. **Scheduled** - Both parties confirmed, session is locked in

**How it works:**
- Either party can propose a time slot
- The proposed time is held for 15 minutes
- The other party confirms or proposes a different time
- When confirmed, payment is processed (for paid sessions)

<CalloutBox type="info">
**New Features (Feb 2026):**
- **Timezone Support**: All times shown in your local timezone
- **Multi-Reminder System**: You'll receive reminders 24 hours, 1 hour, and 15 minutes before your session
- **Quick Ratings**: Rate sessions immediately after completion with a simple 1-5 star rating
- **Recurring Bookings**: Book weekly/monthly sessions in one go
</CalloutBox>

### Step 5: Wait for Confirmation

- Tutors have 24 hours to respond
- You'll receive an email when they accept or decline
- If accepted, you'll get calendar invite and session details
- If declined, no charge is made to your card

### Session Reminders

Once your session is confirmed, you'll receive **3 automatic reminders**:

1. **24 hours before** - Email reminder with session details
2. **1 hour before** - Final preparation reminder
3. **15 minutes before** - Get ready to join!

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Pro Tip**: All times are shown in YOUR local timezone automatically. If you're in New York and your tutor is in London, you'll see times in EST/EDT while they see GMT/BST.
</CalloutBox>

### Step 6: Attend Your Session

**For Online Sessions:**
- Join via the session link in your dashboard
- Test your camera and microphone 5 minutes early
- Have materials ready (notebook, textbooks)

**For In-Person Sessions:**
- Arrive on time at the agreed location
- Bring required materials
- Confirm location details with tutor beforehand

## For Tutors: Managing Bookings

### Setting Your Availability

Keep your calendar updated to receive bookings:

1. Go to your [Dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Click "Manage Availability"
3. Set your regular teaching hours
4. Block out personal commitments (holidays, vacations)
5. Set buffer time between sessions

**New: Block Dates for Holidays/Vacations**

You can now block entire days or specific time ranges:

1. Click "Add Exception Date"
2. Choose exception type:
   - **Holiday**: Bank holidays, public holidays
   - **Vacation**: Personal time off
   - **Personal**: Doctor appointments, emergencies
   - **Unavailable**: Other commitments
3. Select dates (single day or date range)
4. Choose block type:
   - **All day**: Completely unavailable
   - **Specific times**: Block only certain hours (e.g., "2pm-5pm")
5. Confirm exception

**Bulk Import UK Bank Holidays:**
- Click "Import UK Holidays"
- Select year (e.g., 2026)
- All 8 UK bank holidays added automatically

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Important**: Students cannot book during exception dates. These automatically filter out from your availability calendar.
</CalloutBox>

### Receiving Booking Requests

When a student requests a booking:

1. **Email Notification**: You'll receive immediate notification
2. **Dashboard Alert**: Request appears in your dashboard
3. **24-Hour Window**: You have 24 hours to respond

### Accepting Bookings

Review the booking request:
- Student's name and profile
- Requested date and time
- Session duration
- Subject and learning goals
- Any special requests

Click "Accept" if:
- Time slot still works for you
- You're comfortable teaching the subject
- You have materials ready

Click "Decline" if:
- Time no longer available
- Subject outside your expertise
- You need to reschedule

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Response Time**: Responding within 2-4 hours significantly increases your booking acceptance rate.
</CalloutBox>

### Preparing for Sessions

**Before the Session:**
- Review student's learning goals
- Prepare relevant materials
- Test your setup (video, audio, screen share)
- Send any pre-session materials

**During the Session:**
- Start on time
- Follow the agreed curriculum
- Be engaging and patient
- Take notes for follow-up

**After the Session:**
- Send summary notes
- Assign homework if appropriate
- Leave a quick rating (optional)
- Suggest next steps

### Quick Session Ratings

After your session completes, you can immediately rate it with 1-5 stars:

**How it works:**
1. Session ends
2. "Quick Rate This Session" prompt appears
3. Select 1-5 stars (takes 5 seconds)
4. Skip if you want to rate later

**Why quick rate?**
- Capture your immediate impression
- Pre-fills the full review form (you can still add comments later)
- Helps both parties remember the session quality
- You still have 7 days to write a detailed review

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Quick ratings work with our review system**: Your star rating is saved privately. When you submit your full review (within 7 days), the stars are pre-filled but you can change them before final submission.
</CalloutBox>
