<CalloutBox type="info">
**Like Airbnb Wishlists:** Create curated collections like "Best GCSE Maths Tutors in London" or "Top Online Science Teachers" and share them with the world.
</CalloutBox>

## What Are Wiselists?

Wiselists let you:

1. **Save Tutors** - Bookmark your favourite tutors for easy access
2. **Organize Collections** - Create themed lists (by subject, level, location)
3. **Share Publicly** - Generate shareable links for your lists
4. **Track Attribution** - See which lists drive the most bookings
5. **Collaborate** - Invite others to co-edit lists with you

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Growth Engine:** Wiselists boost tutor visibility and create viral growth through social sharing!
</CalloutBox>

## Creating a Wiselist

### Step 1: Navigate to Wiselists

Go to your [Wiselists Dashboard](/wiselists) to see:
- **My Wiselists** - Lists you've created
- **Shared with Me** - Lists others let you edit
- **Saved Items** - Quick view of all saved tutors

### Step 2: Create New List

Click **"Create Wiselist"** and fill in:

**List Name (Required):**
- Clear and descriptive
- Examples: "Best A-Level Physics Tutors", "Affordable GCSE Maths London"
- 60 characters max

**Description (Optional but Recommended):**
- What makes this list special?
- Who is it for?
- Any selection criteria?
- 200 characters max

**Visibility:**
- **Private** - Only you can see (default)
- **Public** - Anyone with link can view
- **Shared** - Specific people you invite

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Pro Tip:** Public lists with great descriptions get shared more and earn more commissions!

**Good Description:**
> "Hand-picked Oxford/Cambridge tutors specializing in 11+ exam prep. All have 5-star ratings and proven track records."

## ~~Wiselist Attribution Tracking~~ ❌ REMOVED

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Feature Removed (Feb 2026)**

Wiselist attribution tracking has been **permanently removed** from TutorWise. Wiselists are now organizational tools only.

**What This Means:**
- ❌ No tracking cookies for wiselist referrals
- ❌ No attribution of bookings to wiselists
- ❌ No referral bonuses from shared lists
- ✅ You can still create and share wiselists
- ✅ Wiselists remain useful for organizing your saved tutors
</CalloutBox>

### ~~How Attribution Works~~ (No Longer Applicable)

~~When you share a wiselist publicly, we track its impact:~~

**This feature has been removed. Below is the original documentation for reference:**

**~~Attribution Flow~~:**
1. ~~Someone clicks your shared wiselist link~~
2. ~~We set a tracking cookie (7-day attribution window)~~
3. ~~If they book a tutor from your list within 7 days~~
4. ~~That booking is attributed to your wiselist~~
5. ~~You can see this in your wiselist analytics~~

**~~What Gets Tracked~~:** None - feature removed
- ~~Wiselist views (how many people opened your link)~~
- ~~Tutors viewed from your list~~
- ~~Bookings made from your shared list~~
- ~~Conversion rate (views → bookings)~~


### Creating High-Impact Lists

**Quality Over Quantity:**
- Curate carefully (only great tutors)
- Write compelling descriptions
- Focus on specific niches
- Update regularly with new finds

**Strategic Sharing:**
- Target relevant communities
- Share during peak search times (August for GCSE, January for 11+)
- Build trust before promoting
- Provide genuine value, not just links

**Optimize for Discovery:**
- Use clear, searchable names
- Include location and subject
- Add helpful selection criteria
- Keep lists focused (5-15 tutors ideal)

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best Performers:** Lists with 7-12 tutors, specific niches, and authentic descriptions generate 3x more bookings than generic "best tutors" lists.
</CalloutBox>

**Private Information:**

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I save listings instead of just tutors?**
A: Currently, wiselists support tutors only. Saving specific listings is coming soon!

**Q: Why isn't my shared link working?**
A: Check that visibility is set to "Public". Private lists don't generate working share links.

**Q: How do I track bookings from my wiselists?**
A: Visit your individual wiselist page to see attribution stats, including how many bookings came from your shared link.

**Q: Can I export my wiselist?**
A: Not currently, but you can share the public link or take screenshots. CSV export coming soon!

**Q: Someone removed me as a collaborator. Can I get access back?**
A: No, only the list owner can re-invite you. Request access from them directly.

**Q: Do wiselists expire?**
A: No, wiselists remain active indefinitely unless you delete them.

**Q: How many wiselists can I create?**
A: Unlimited! Create as many as you need for different purposes.

**Q: Will tutors know if I save them to a wiselist?**
A: No, tutors only see their total save count, not who saved them or which lists they're in.
