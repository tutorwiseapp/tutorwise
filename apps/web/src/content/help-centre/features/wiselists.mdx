# Wiselists: Save & Share Tutors

Wiselists are your personal collections of favourite tutors and resources. Save tutors you love, organise them into lists, share publicly, and earn commissions when people book!

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Like Airbnb Wishlists:** Create curated collections like "Best GCSE Maths Tutors in London" or "Top Online Science Teachers" and share them with the world.
</CalloutBox>

## What Are Wiselists?

Wiselists let you:

1. **Save Tutors** - Bookmark your favourite tutors for easy access
2. **Organize Collections** - Create themed lists (by subject, level, location)
3. **Share Publicly** - Generate shareable links for your lists
4. **Earn Commissions** - Get 5% when someone books from your shared list
5. **Collaborate** - Invite others to co-edit lists with you

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Growth Engine:** Wiselists boost tutor visibility and create viral growth through social sharing!
</CalloutBox>

## Creating a Wiselist

### Step 1: Navigate to Wiselists

Go to your [Wiselists Dashboard](/wiselists) to see:

### Step 2: Create New List

Click **"Create Wiselist"** and fill in:

**Visibility:**

## Earning Commission from Wiselists

### How Commission Works

**You Earn 5% When:**
1. Someone clicks your shared wiselist link
2. They browse and find a tutor
3. They book a session with that tutor
4. The session completes successfully
5. You receive 5% of the booking value

**Commission Calculation:**
```
Booking Price:       £100
Platform Fee (10%):  -£10
Tutor Earns:         £90
Your Commission (5%): £5
```

**Tracking:**
- View commission in [Referrals Dashboard](/referrals)
- See which lists generate revenue
- Track clicks vs. conversions
- Monthly payout with other earnings

### Maximizing Your Earnings

**Create High-Quality Lists:**
- Curate carefully (only great tutors)
- Write compelling descriptions
- Focus on specific niches
- Update regularly with new finds

**Promote Strategically:**
- Target relevant communities
- Share during peak search times (August for GCSE, January for 11+)
- Build trust before promoting
- Provide genuine value, not just links

**Optimize for Discovery:**
- Use clear, searchable names
- Include location and subject
- Add helpful selection criteria
- Keep lists focused (5-15 tutors ideal)

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best Performers:** Lists with 7-12 tutors, specific niches, and authentic descriptions convert 3x better than generic "best tutors" lists.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I save listings instead of just tutors?**
A: Currently, wiselists support tutors only. Saving specific listings is coming soon!

**Q: Why isn't my shared link working?**
A: Check that visibility is set to "Public". Private lists don't generate working share links.

**Q: How do I track commission from my wiselists?**
A: Go to [Referrals Dashboard](/referrals) and filter by "Wiselist Referrals" to see earnings.

**Q: Can I export my wiselist?**
A: Not currently, but you can share the public link or take screenshots. CSV export coming soon!

**Q: Someone removed me as a collaborator. Can I get access back?**
A: No, only the list owner can re-invite you. Request access from them directly.

**Q: Do wiselists expire?**
A: No, wiselists remain active indefinitely unless you delete them.

**Q: How many wiselists can I create?**
A: Unlimited! Create as many as you need for different purposes.

**Q: Will tutors know if I save them to a wiselist?**
A: No, tutors only see their total save count, not who saved them or which lists they're in.
