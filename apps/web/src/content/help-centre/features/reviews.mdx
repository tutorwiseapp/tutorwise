**Why It Matters:** Reviews affect your [Credibility Score (CaaS)](/help-centre/features/caas), marketplace visibility, and booking conversion rates.
</CalloutBox>

## How Reviews Work

### The Blind Escrow System

Tutorwise uses a 7-day **blind escrow period** to encourage honest feedback:

1. **Session Completes** → Review opportunity created
2. **Both Parties Write Reviews** → Reviews stay hidden from each other
3. **All Submit** → Reviews publish immediately (before 7 days)
4. **Or Deadline Passes** → Reviews auto-publish after 7 days

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Key Benefit:** You write reviews knowing the other person can't see yours until both submit. This prevents retaliation and encourages honesty!
</CalloutBox>

### Why 7 Days?

The escrow period solves the "reciprocity problem":
- Without escrow: Fear of bad reviews leads to inflated ratings
- With escrow: Honest feedback without fear of retaliation
- Early publication: Rewards prompt engagement (no need to wait 7 days!)

## Leaving a Review

### Step 1: Access Pending Reviews

After completing a session, you'll receive notifications:

**Email Notification:**
- Sent within 1 hour of session completion
- Includes direct link to review form
- Reminder sent 24 hours before deadline

**In-App Notification:**
- Dashboard alert
- Reviews hub shows pending reviews
- Countdown timer to deadline

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Pro Tip:** Submit reviews within 24 hours while the session is fresh in your mind. Better feedback quality and faster publication!
</CalloutBox>

### Step 2: Navigate to Reviews Hub

Go to [Reviews Dashboard](/reviews) to see:

**Three Tabs:**
1. **Pending** - Reviews you need to write
2. **Received** - Feedback others gave you
3. **Given** - Feedback you've written

### Step 3: Write Your Review

Click on a pending review to open the form:

**Star Rating (Required):**
- 5 stars: Exceptional
- 4 stars: Great
- 3 stars: Good
- 2 stars: Fair
- 1 star: Poor

**Written Feedback (Optional but Recommended):**
- What went well?
- Areas for improvement
- Would you recommend them?
- Any standout moments?

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Be Professional:** Reviews are public and permanent. Focus on constructive feedback, not personal attacks.
</CalloutBox>

### Step 4: Submit

Once submitted:
- You **cannot** edit or delete reviews
- Review enters escrow (hidden from other party)
- You'll be notified when it publishes
- It counts toward the other person's average rating

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't I see the review someone left for me?**
A: Reviews stay hidden during the 7-day escrow period. They'll publish when either: (1) all participants submit, or (2) the deadline passes.

**Q: I accidentally submitted the wrong rating. Can I edit?**
A: No, reviews are final once submitted. This prevents gaming the system. Be thoughtful before clicking submit.

**Q: Someone left an unfair/inappropriate review. What do I do?**
A: Email support@tutorwise.com with:
- Review link/screenshot
- Explanation of the issue
- Any supporting evidence
We review all disputes within 48 hours.

**Q: Do reviews affect my Credibility Score?**
A: Yes! Average rating contributes 0-15 points to your CaaS Performance bucket. Learn more in our [CaaS Guide](/help-centre/features/caas).

**Q: Can I opt out of reviews?**
A: No, reviews are mandatory for all completed sessions. They're essential for platform trust and quality.

**Q: What if the other person never submits their review?**
A: Your review will still publish after 7 days. Their opportunity to leave feedback expires.

**Q: Are reviews truly anonymous during escrow?**
A: Yes. Neither party can see the other's review until publication. Reviews are encrypted and stored separately.

**Q: Do free sessions generate reviews?**
A: Yes! Free Help Now sessions create review opportunities, contributing to your CaaS Social Impact score.
