## Troubleshooting

**Q: I toggled "Available" but no requests are coming. Why?**
A: Check:
- Profile completeness (photo, bio, subjects)
- At least one active listing
- Subject demand (some subjects get more requests)
- Time of day (peak: 4pm-9pm weekdays)

**Q: Can I charge for Free Help sessions?**
A: No, they're strictly free. Use regular bookings for paid sessions.

**Q: Student didn't show up. Do I still get credit?**
A: No, only completed sessions count toward CaaS. Mark as "no-show" if student doesn't join.

**Q: How long until I get my CaaS points?**
A: Points are calculated when you complete 1, 5, or 10 sessions. Updates within 10 minutes.

**Q: Can agents/organisations use Free Help?**
A: Currently tutors only. We're exploring organisation-sponsored free help in the future!

**Q: I hit my 5-session weekly limit. When does it reset?**
A: Rolling 7-day window. If your 5th session was Monday, you can take another the following Monday.
