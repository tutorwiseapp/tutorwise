## What Are AI Tutors?

AI Tutors are specialised AI-powered tutors available alongside human tutors in the Tutorwise marketplace. Each AI tutor is trained on specific subject materials, giving you expert-level help tailored to particular topics and curricula.

Unlike a general-purpose study tool, each AI tutor has its own:

- **Subject expertise** — trained on curated materials for specific topics
- **Teaching style** — adapted to deliver clear, structured explanations
- **Knowledge base** — references real teaching resources when answering your questions
- **Availability** — online 24/7, ready to start instantly

AI tutors are created by experienced tutors and by the Tutorwise platform itself, so you always have access to high-quality, curriculum-aligned help.

### Who Are AI Tutors For?

| Role | How AI Tutors Help |
|------|-------------------|
| **Students** | Instant homework help, concept explanations, exam revision, practice exercises — any time of day |
| **Parents** | On-demand support for your child's learning without waiting for a booking |
| **Tutors** | Recommend AI tutors to your students for practice between human sessions |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**AI Tutors vs Sage:** AI Tutors are **subject specialists** — each one is trained on specific materials and curricula for focused, in-depth help. [Sage](/sage) is your **general-purpose study assistant** for broader questions across Maths, English, and Science. Use AI Tutors when you need deep subject expertise; use Sage for everyday study help.
</CalloutBox>

## Finding AI Tutors

AI Tutors appear in the [Marketplace](/marketplace) alongside human tutors. Here's how to find them:

1. Go to the [Marketplace](/marketplace)
2. Browse or search for your subject
3. Look for the **"AI Tutor"** badge on tutor cards
4. AI tutors also display an **"Available 24/7"** label and an **"Instant"** availability badge

### What You'll See on an AI Tutor Card

Each AI tutor card in the marketplace shows:

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI Tutor badge** | Identifies the tutor as AI-powered |
| **Display name** | The AI tutor's name |
| **Subject & skills** | What topics the tutor specialises in |
| **Rating & reviews** | Star rating and review count from other users |
| **Session count** | How many sessions the tutor has completed (or "New AI tutor" if recently created) |
| **Price** | Cost per hour |
| **Availability** | Always shows "Available 24/7" |

## Starting a Session

Starting a session with an AI tutor is instant — no booking or scheduling needed:

1. **Find an AI tutor** in the [Marketplace](/marketplace)
2. **View the tutor's profile** to check their subject, skills, and reviews
3. **Start a session** — you'll be taken straight into a live chat
4. **Ask your question** and receive an immediate, streaming response

Each session lasts up to **1 hour**. You can end a session early at any time.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**No waiting.** Unlike human tutor bookings, AI tutor sessions start immediately. Ask your first question and get a response within seconds.
</CalloutBox>

## During a Session

### Real-Time Responses

AI tutor responses stream in real time — you see words appear as they're generated, just like chatting with a real tutor. No waiting for the full answer before you start reading.

### Formatted Content

AI tutors render content beautifully:

- **Mathematical notation** — equations, fractions, Greek symbols, and formulas display correctly using LaTeX
- **Structured explanations** — step-by-step working, bullet points, and tables
- **Code and formulas** — properly formatted for easy reading

### Source Attribution

When an AI tutor references its training materials to answer your question, you'll see a **source indicator** showing which materials were used. This helps you understand where the information comes from and builds confidence in the answers.

### Session Timer

Every session has a **1-hour timer** displayed at the top of the chat:

| Time Remaining | Indicator |
|---------------|-----------|
| More than 5 minutes | Normal countdown |
| 5 minutes or less | Yellow warning |
| 1 minute or less | Red critical warning |
| Time's up | Session ends automatically |

You can always end a session early by clicking the **"End Session"** button.

### Need a Human Tutor?

During any AI tutor session, you can click **"Need help from a human tutor?"** to escalate. This takes you to the marketplace to find and book a human tutor for more personalised, in-depth support.

## After a Session

When your session ends (either manually or when time runs out), you'll be asked to **rate your experience**:

- **5-star rating** — from Poor to Excellent
- **Optional written review** — share feedback in up to 2,000 characters
- **Browse Human Tutors** — a quick link to find human tutors if you'd like deeper support

Your reviews help other users find the best AI tutors and help tutors improve their AI tutor offerings.

## Session Bundles

Save money by purchasing **session bundles** that combine AI and human tutor sessions at discounted rates.

### What's in a Bundle?

Bundles typically include a mix of:

- **AI tutor sessions** — for instant, on-demand help
- **Human tutor sessions** — for deeper, personalised learning

Each bundle shows the **total price**, **savings percentage**, and **how many sessions** of each type are included.

### Managing Your Bundles

Go to [My Bundles](/ai-tutors/my-bundles) to:

- View your active bundles
- See remaining sessions (AI and human) with progress bars
- Track bundle expiry dates
- Purchase new bundles

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best value.** Bundles can save you up to 15% compared to booking sessions individually. They're ideal if you study regularly and want a mix of instant AI help and scheduled human tutor sessions.
</CalloutBox>

## Pricing

| Option | Price | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Per session** | Varies by tutor | Each AI tutor sets their own hourly rate, shown on their marketplace card |
| **Bundles** | Discounted | Save up to 15% with multi-session bundles combining AI and human sessions |

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Platform AI Tutors** created by Tutorwise are competitively priced and maintained to the highest quality standards. Look for the platform badge in the marketplace.
</CalloutBox>

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific.** "Explain how to balance chemical equations" works better than "help with chemistry"
2. **Mention your level.** "I'm studying for GCSE" helps the AI tutor pitch explanations correctly
3. **Ask for steps.** "Show me step by step" gives you the working, not just the answer
4. **Use follow-ups.** Ask "explain further" or "give me another example" to deepen understanding
5. **Try bundles.** If you study regularly, bundles give you the best value
6. **Leave reviews.** Your feedback helps other students find the best AI tutors

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I use an AI tutor without booking?**
A: Yes. AI tutor sessions start instantly — just click to begin. No booking or scheduling required.

**Q: What happens when my session time runs out?**
A: The session ends automatically after 1 hour. You'll see warnings at 5 minutes and 1 minute remaining. You can always start a new session.

**Q: Can I switch AI tutors mid-session?**
A: You'll need to end your current session first, then start a new one with a different AI tutor.

**Q: Are AI tutor conversations private?**
A: Yes. Your session history and messages are private to you.

**Q: How are AI tutors different from Sage?**
A: AI tutors are subject specialists trained on specific materials and curricula. [Sage](/sage) is a general-purpose study assistant. For deep, focused help on a particular topic, choose an AI tutor. For everyday study questions, use Sage.

**Q: What if I need more help than an AI tutor can provide?**
A: During any session, click "Need help from a human tutor?" to find and book a human tutor on the [Marketplace](/marketplace).

**Q: How do bundles work?**
A: Bundles give you a set number of AI and human tutor sessions at a discounted rate. Purchase bundles from [My Bundles](/ai-tutors/my-bundles), then redeem sessions as you need them.
