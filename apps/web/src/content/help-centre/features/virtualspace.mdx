**Three ways to collaborate.** VirtualSpace works as an instant whiteboard room, a booking-linked session with CaaS scoring, or a Free Help Now session — all with the same powerful tools.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Quick Access:** Go to [VirtualSpace](/virtualspace) to create or join a session. For booked sessions, click "Join Session" from your [Bookings](/bookings) page.

## What Is VirtualSpace?

VirtualSpace is Tutorwise's built-in collaboration environment for real-time learning. It combines an interactive whiteboard with video calling so you can teach, learn, and work together — all within the platform.

- **Interactive whiteboard** powered by tldraw — draw, annotate, and collaborate in real time
- **Google Meet integration** for video and audio alongside the whiteboard
- **Invite links** to share rooms with anyone on the platform
- **Whiteboard snapshots** saved automatically for future reference
- **Real-time sync** via Ably — all participants see changes instantly
- **CaaS integration** for booking sessions that count toward your Credibility Score

### Three Session Modes

VirtualSpace adapts to how you want to use it:

| Mode | Best For | Expiry | CaaS Impact |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Standalone** | Ad-hoc collaboration, study groups, brainstorming | 24 hours | No |
| **Booking** | Scheduled tutoring sessions linked to a booking | No expiry | Yes (+3 points for 80%+ usage) |
| **Free Help** | Instant sessions via Free Help Now | 24 hours | No |

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**CaaS Boost:** Using VirtualSpace for 80%+ of your booked sessions earns +3 Credibility Score points in the Digital Professionalism bucket. See [CaaS Guide](/help-centre/features/caas) for details.
</CalloutBox>

## Standalone Mode

Create an instant whiteboard room for ad-hoc collaboration — no booking required.

### Creating a Standalone Session

1. Go to [VirtualSpace](/virtualspace)
2. Click **"Create Session"**
3. Give your session a title (optional — defaults to "Untitled Session")
4. Your room is created instantly with a unique invite link
5. Share the link with participants

### Invite Links

When you create a standalone session, you get a shareable invite link:
- **Unique token** — each link is tied to one session
- **24-hour expiry** — links expire after 24 hours for security
- **Up to 10 participants** — collaborate with a group
- **Authentication required** — participants must be signed in to Tutorwise

### Use Cases

- Study groups working through problems together
- Tutors brainstorming lesson ideas with colleagues
- Quick whiteboard sessions for explaining a concept
- Collaborative note-taking during a revision session

## Booking Mode

When you join a VirtualSpace session linked to a booking, you get the full tutoring experience.

### Joining a Booked Session

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Students">
    1. Go to [Bookings](/bookings) or your [Dashboard](/dashboard)
    2. Find your upcoming session
    3. Click **"Join Session"** (available 5 minutes before start)
    4. VirtualSpace opens with the whiteboard and Google Meet
    5. Your tutor appears when they join
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Tutors">
    1. Go to [Bookings](/bookings)
    2. Find the upcoming session
    3. Click **"Start Session"**
    4. VirtualSpace opens — prepare your whiteboard while waiting
    5. Student joins automatically when they click their link

    **After the session:**
    - Click **"Complete Session"** in the header
    - This marks the booking as completed
    - CaaS recalculation is triggered automatically
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Booking Mode Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-created** | VirtualSpace session created when booking is confirmed |
| **No expiry** | Session stays available as long as the booking exists |
| **Complete button** | Tutor can mark session as completed (triggers CaaS) |
| **Participant lock** | Only the booked tutor and student can join |

<CalloutBox type="info">
**CaaS Integration:** Completing a booking session through VirtualSpace contributes to your Digital Professionalism score. The platform tracks your VirtualSpace usage rate automatically.
</CalloutBox>

## Free Help Mode

Free Help Now sessions include VirtualSpace so you can use the whiteboard during instant sessions.

### How It Works

1. A student requests **Free Help Now** from the [Marketplace](/marketplace)
2. A tutor accepts the request
3. Both a Google Meet link **and** a VirtualSpace session are created
4. Redirect to VirtualSpace with the whiteboard and Meet embedded
5. Session expires after 24 hours

### Free Help vs Booking Sessions

| | Free Help | Booking |
|---|-----------|---------|
| **Created by** | Free Help Now request | Booking confirmation |
| **Duration** | Flexible (24hr expiry) | Matches booking duration |
| **CaaS impact** | No | Yes |
| **Participants** | Tutor + student | Tutor + student |
| **Complete button** | No | Yes (tutor only) |

## The Whiteboard

VirtualSpace's interactive whiteboard is powered by tldraw — a professional-grade drawing tool built for collaboration.

### Drawing Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Select** | Move and resize objects |
| **Draw** | Freehand pen tool (multiple colours and sizes) |
| **Eraser** | Remove drawn elements |
| **Arrow** | Draw arrows between points |
| **Text** | Add text labels and annotations |
| **Shapes** | Rectangle, ellipse, diamond, and more |
| **Note** | Sticky notes for quick annotations |
| **Laser** | Temporary pointer for presentations |

### Real-Time Collaboration

The whiteboard syncs in real time across all participants:
- See each other's cursors and selections
- Changes appear instantly (powered by Ably real-time channels)
- No lag — CRDT-based sync ensures consistency
- Multiple users can draw simultaneously

### Saving Snapshots

Click **"Save Snapshot"** in the session header to save the current whiteboard state:
- Snapshot is stored as a JSON file in secure storage
- Can be restored to review past work
- Available from the session details after the session ends

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Snapshot before completing.** Save a whiteboard snapshot before marking a booking session as complete — the snapshot captures all your work for future reference.
</CalloutBox>

## Google Meet Integration

VirtualSpace includes Google Meet for video and audio alongside the whiteboard.

### How Meet Works

- A Google Meet link is generated when the session starts
- Meet opens in a panel alongside the whiteboard
- Both tutor and student join the same Meet room
- Audio and video run through Meet while you collaborate on the whiteboard

### Best Setup

- **Dual-screen** or **side-by-side layout** — whiteboard on one side, Meet on the other
- **Headset with microphone** — reduces echo and background noise
- **Stable internet** — 10 Mbps+ recommended for smooth video + whiteboard sync

## Session Management

### Your Sessions Dashboard

Go to [VirtualSpace](/virtualspace) to see all your sessions:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | Session name |
| **Mode** | Standalone, Booking, or Free Help badge |
| **Status** | Active, Completed, or Expired |
| **Participants** | Number of people in the session |
| **Last Activity** | When the session was last used |

### Session Lifecycle

|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Session is open and can be joined |
| **Completed** | Tutor marked the session as complete (booking mode) |
| **Expired** | 24-hour time limit reached (standalone and free help modes) |

### Participant Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access — invite, kick, edit, save snapshot, end session |
| **Collaborator** | Draw on whiteboard, save snapshots |
| **Viewer** | View the whiteboard (read-only) |

## Access Control

| Mode | Who Can Join | How |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Standalone** | Anyone with the invite link (must be signed in) | Invite URL shared by owner |
| **Booking** | Booked tutor and student only | From Bookings page or Dashboard |
| **Free Help** | Matched tutor and student only | Auto-redirect from Free Help Now |

## Best Practices

**For Tutors:**
- Test your whiteboard tools before the student joins
- Save snapshots of key explanations
- Use the laser pointer to highlight areas during verbal explanations
- Prepare whiteboard templates for common lesson types
- Complete sessions through VirtualSpace for CaaS credit

**For Students:**
- Join 2–3 minutes early to test your setup
- Use the draw tools to show your working
- Ask your tutor to save snapshots of key concepts
- Use sticky notes for questions during the session

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My invite link says "expired". What do I do?**
A: Standalone invite links expire after 24 hours. Ask the session owner to create a new session with a fresh link.

**Q: The whiteboard isn't syncing. How do I fix it?**
A: Try:
- Refresh the page
- Check your internet connection
- Close other browser tabs to free up resources
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility

**Q: I can't see the "Complete" button. Where is it?**
A: The Complete button only appears in **booking mode** for the **tutor**. If you're in a standalone or free help session, there's no Complete action — the session expires automatically.

**Q: Can I use VirtualSpace on mobile?**
A: VirtualSpace works best on desktop or laptop with Chrome. Mobile support is limited — the whiteboard tools require a larger screen for comfortable use.

**Q: My whiteboard snapshot didn't save. What happened?**
A: Check your internet connection and try again. Snapshots require an active connection to upload. If the issue persists, try refreshing the page and saving again.

**Q: How do I switch between the whiteboard and Google Meet?**
A: Both the whiteboard and Meet panel are visible simultaneously. On smaller screens, you can toggle between them using the layout controls in the header.

**Q: Can I rejoin a session after leaving?**
A: Yes, as long as the session is still active (not expired or completed). Go to [VirtualSpace](/virtualspace) and click the session, or use the original invite link.
