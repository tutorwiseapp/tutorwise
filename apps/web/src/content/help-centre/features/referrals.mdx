# Refer & Earn: Complete Guide

Earn **lifetime commissions** by referring tutors to Tutorwise. Our unique "Refer Anyone To Anyone" (RATA) system lets anyone with a referral code earn passive income.

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Earn 10% commission FOREVER** on all bookings made by tutors you refer. No time limits, no expiry.
</CalloutBox>

---

## Quick Start: 3 Simple Steps

### 1. Get Your Referral Link

Every user automatically gets a unique referral code (e.g., `kRz7Bq2`).

**Find your code:**
1. Go to [Referrals Dashboard](/referrals)
2. Your code appears at the top
3. Copy your referral link: `https://tutorwise.com/a/YOUR_CODE`

### 2. Share Your Link

**Best places to share:**
- Social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter)
- Email to colleagues
- Teaching forums and groups
- Educational communities
- WhatsApp groups
- Your website or blog

### 3. Earn Automatically

When someone signs up through your link and becomes a tutor:
- ✅ You earn **10% commission** on ALL their future bookings
- ✅ **Lifetime attribution** - no expiry date
- ✅ Passive income forever
- ✅ Automatic tracking and payments

---

## How Referrals Work

### The RATA System: Refer Anyone To Anyone

Unlike traditional referral programs, **anyone can refer anyone** on Tutorwise:

- **Tutors** can refer other tutors
- **Students** can refer tutors
- **Agents** can refer tutors (without being tutors themselves)
- **Organizations** can refer tutors
- **Anyone** with a referral code can earn

**Multi-Role Architecture:**
You can be multiple things at once:
- A tutor who also refers other tutors
- A student who earns by referring tutors
- An agent who focuses only on referrals

---

## Commission Structure

### Standard Split (80/10/10)

When a referred tutor completes a **£100 booking:**

```
Total Booking:           £100.00
├─ Platform Fee:         £10.00  (10%)
├─ Agent Commission:     £10.00  (10%) ← YOU EARN THIS
└─ Tutor Payout:         £80.00  (80%)
```

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Important:** Commission is calculated on the **total booking amount**, not the tutor's payout.
</CalloutBox>

### Who Earns Commissions?

#### ✅ Scenario 1: You Refer a Tutor (Lifetime Commission)

```
You → Refer Tutor T → Tutor T gets bookings
Result: You earn 10% on ALL Tutor T's future bookings FOREVER
```

**Example:**
- You refer Sarah (a tutor)
- Sarah completes £5,000 in bookings this year
- **You earn: £500** (10% of £5,000)
- Sarah continues tutoring next year
- **You continue earning 10%** (no time limit!)

#### ✅ Scenario 2: You're a Tutor Who Refers a Client

```
You (tutor) → Refer Client C → Client C books with YOU specifically
Result: You earn 10% commission (plus your 80% tutor payout)
```

**Example:**
- You're a math tutor
- You refer a student via QR code
- Student books a £50 session **with you**
- You earn: £40 (80% tutor) + £5 (10% referral) = **£45 total**

**Important:** If the client books with a **different tutor**, you don't earn the referral commission. Commission only applies when the client books with the tutor who referred them.

#### ❌ Scenario 3: Third-Party Agent Protection

```
Agent A → Referred Tutor T
Agent B → Referred Client C
Client C books with Tutor T

Result: Agent B gets commission (protected third-party attribution)
```

The agent who brought the client ALWAYS gets paid, even if the tutor has delegation configured. This protects lifetime attribution rights.

---

## Attribution: How Referrals Are Tracked

Tutorwise uses **hierarchical attribution** with three capture methods:

### Priority 1: URL Parameter (Highest)

When someone clicks your referral link:
```
https://tutorwise.com/a/kRz7Bq2
```

If they sign up immediately, attribution is via **URL parameter**.

### Priority 2: Cookie Fallback

If they don't sign up immediately:
- Secure HMAC-signed cookie set (30 days)
- Returns later and signs up
- Attribution is via **cookie**

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Smart Tracking:** Cookies are tamper-proof with cryptographic signatures. Users can clear cookies and still be attributed via manual code.
</CalloutBox>

### Priority 3: Manual Entry

During signup, users can manually enter your referral code:
```
Enter referral code (optional): kRz7Bq2
```

**Case-insensitive matching**, so `kRz7Bq2`, `KRZ7BQ2`, or `krz7bq2` all work.

---

## Advanced Features

### QR Code Generation

Perfect for **offline promotion** (coffee shops, flyers, business cards):

**How to create QR codes:**
1. Go to [Referrals Dashboard](/referrals)
2. Click "Generate QR Code"
3. Download and print
4. Display at partner locations

**Use cases:**
- Coffee shops display your QR code
- Community centers promote your tutoring
- School bulletin boards
- Printed marketing materials

**Commission flow:**
```
Customer scans QR → Signs up as tutor → You earn 10% forever
```

### Commission Delegation

Delegate your commissions to partners who help you promote.

#### What is Delegation?

**Delegation** lets you assign commission to someone else when:
- You're a tutor who refers a client to yourself
- You want partners to earn for displaying your QR codes
- You're building a partnership network

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Key Rule:** Delegation ONLY applies when you (the tutor) are the direct referrer of the client. If a third-party agent brings the client, the original agent gets paid regardless of delegation.
</CalloutBox>

#### Two Levels of Delegation

**1. Profile-Level Default** (applies to all your listings)

Set a default delegation target for all your tutoring services:

```
Settings → Referral Preferences → Default Delegation
Search for partner by referral code: ABC1234
Save
```

**2. Listing-Level Override** (specific listing only)

Override the default for a specific subject/service:

```
Listings → Edit Listing → Delegation Settings
Delegate commission to: XYZ5678
Save
```

**Hierarchy:** Listing-level overrides profile-level.

#### Delegation Example

**Setup:**
- You're a tutor (Math tutoring listing)
- Profile default delegation: Marketing Agency M
- Listing override delegation: Coffee Shop P
- You create a QR code for your math listing

**Scenario:**
1. Customer scans QR at Coffee Shop P
2. Customer signs up and books **your math session**
3. **Coffee Shop P earns £10 commission** (listing override)
4. Marketing Agency M earns nothing (overridden)

**Why this works:**
- You referred the client (via your QR code)
- Listing delegation applies
- You still earn £80 as the tutor

#### When Delegation Doesn't Apply

**Third-Party Protection:**

```
Agent A referred you (the tutor)
Agent B referred the client
Client books with you

Result: Agent B gets commission (NOT your delegation target)
```

This protects agents who bring clients from having their commissions redirected.

## Maximizing Your Earnings

### Target High-Value Tutors

**Look for:**
- **Experienced tutors** (more bookings)
- **Specialists** in high-demand subjects (Maths, Science, 11+)
- **Full-time tutors** (£2K-5K/month potential)
- **Tutors with existing student base**

**Why it matters:**
- 1 active tutor (£3K/month) = £300/month commission
- Better than 10 inactive tutors (£0/month)

### Effective Sharing Strategies

#### For Social Media

**LinkedIn Strategy:**
1. Share your tutoring success story
2. Post about earning passive income
3. Create tutorial videos
4. Join educator groups
5. Include referral link in posts

**Example post:**
```
"I've earned £2,400 in passive income this year by referring
5 tutors to @Tutorwise. If you're an educator looking for
flexible work, check it out: [your link]"
```

#### For Direct Outreach

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Earn £30-50/hour tutoring online

Hi [Name],

I've been tutoring on Tutorwise for 6 months and wanted to
share it with you. Here's why I recommend it:

✅ Set your own rates (I charge £40/hour)
✅ Flexible schedule
✅ Payment security
✅ Great student quality

If you sign up through my link, I earn a small commission
(at no cost to you): [your link]

Happy to answer questions!

[Your name]
```

#### For Content Marketing

**Blog post ideas:**
- "How I Earn £500/Month Passively"
- "Best Online Tutoring Platforms (2025 Comparison)"
- "Teaching Tips for New Tutors"
- "Side Hustle: Tutoring Online"

Include your referral link naturally in the content.

### Partnership Strategies

**Coffee Shop Partnership:**
1. Approach local coffee shop
2. Offer to share commission (via delegation)
3. Create branded QR code
4. Display on table tents
5. Coffee shop earns passive income

**Example pitch:**
```
"I'm a tutor and want to display my QR code here. When
customers sign up as tutors, you'll earn £10 per booking
they make. Zero cost to you, just display the QR code."
```

## Delegation Setup Guide

4. Verify partner exists
5. Click "Save Default"

### Setting Listing-Specific Delegation

**Use case:** You want a specific coffee shop to earn from your Math listing.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Listings](/listings)
2. Click "Edit" on your Math listing
3. Scroll to "Delegation Settings"

## Common Questions

### About Commissions

**How long do I earn commissions?**
**Forever.** There's no time limit. As long as the tutor you referred keeps getting bookings, you keep earning 10%.

**Can I refer myself?**
No. Self-referrals are blocked by the system.

**What if I refer a student?**
If you're a tutor and refer a student who books with **you**, you earn 10% commission (plus your 80% tutor payout). If they book with someone else, you don't earn referral commission.

**Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?**
No limit. Refer as many people as you want.

### About Attribution

**What if someone uses multiple referral codes?**
The system uses **hierarchical attribution**:
1. URL parameter (if they signed up via direct link)
2. Cookie (if they clicked link earlier)
3. Manual entry (if they typed code during signup)

The first valid method wins.

**Do referrals need to use my link?**
Not necessarily. They can also:
- Click your link (sets cookie for 30 days)
- Scan your QR code
- Manually enter your code during signup

All three methods work.

**Can someone change who referred them?**
No. Once set, the `referred_by` field is **immutable** and cannot be changed. This protects your lifetime attribution rights.

### About Payments

**When do I get paid?**
Currently, withdrawals are **manual**:
1. Commission becomes "Available" after 7-day clearing period
2. You request withdrawal (minimum £25)
3. Funds transfer to your Stripe account (2-3 days)
4. Then to your bank (2-5 days)

**Can I set up automatic withdrawals?**
Not yet. This feature is planned for Q2 2026.

**What if there's a refund?**
If a booking is refunded, the commission transaction is cancelled and removed from your balance.

### About Delegation

**When should I use delegation?**
Use delegation when:
- You want partners to earn for promoting you
- You're building a partnership network (coffee shops, schools)
- You want to incentivize others to display your QR codes

**Can I delegate 100% of my commission?**
No. You can only delegate when **you're the tutor** who referred the client. The commission you can delegate is the 10% referral commission, not your tutor payout.

**What if I have both profile and listing delegation set?**
Listing-level overrides profile-level. The hierarchy is:
1. Listing-specific delegation (highest priority)
2. Profile default delegation
3. Original attribution (your tutor's referring agent)
