# Tutorwise Referrals — Refer & Earn

Tutorwise includes a built-in referral system that allows tutors, clients, and agents to earn commission by introducing tutors and clients to the platform.

<CalloutBox type="info">
Referrals work both online and offline and are designed to support long-term collaboration while protecting attribution and rewards fairly.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is a Referral on Tutorwise?

A referral happens when someone joins Tutorwise or makes a booking as a result of a recommendation you shared — such as a referral link, QR code, or direct recommendation.

Tutorwise automatically tracks referrals and allocates rewards when qualifying bookings are completed.

## How Referrals Work (Overview)

Tutorwise referrals follow three simple steps:

### 1. Get Your Referral Link or QR Code

Every Tutorwise user has a unique referral link and QR code available from their dashboard.

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**You can:**
- Share the link online (WhatsApp, social media, email)
- Display the QR code offline (shops, schools, community spaces)
- Recommend tutors directly from your network
</CalloutBox>

### 2. Share with Tutors or Clients

You can refer in multiple ways:
- Invite tutors to join Tutorwise
- Invite clients to book tutoring
- Recommend tutors to clients you already know
- Promote Tutorwise locally or online

Tutorwise records referral attribution automatically when someone signs up or books using your link or QR code.

### 3. Earn Referral Rewards

When a referred tutor or client completes a paid booking, Tutorwise calculates referral rewards automatically.

<CalloutBox type="success">
**You can view:**
- Referral activity
- Completed bookings
- Pending and available rewards

from your dashboard at any time.
</CalloutBox>

## Types of Referrals on Tutorwise

Tutorwise supports different referral roles using the same underlying system.

### Referring Tutors (Supply-Side Referrals)

If you invite a tutor to join Tutorwise:
- You earn referral rewards when that tutor delivers paid lessons or sells products
- Attribution is recorded when the tutor signs up
- Rewards may continue on future qualifying activity

<CalloutBox type="info">
**This is suitable for:**
- Tutor recruiters
- Education partners
- Tutors building a trusted network
</CalloutBox>

### Referring Clients (Demand-Side Referrals)

If you invite clients to Tutorwise:
- You earn referral rewards when referred clients book and complete paid sessions
- Works both online and offline
- Suitable for individuals, local businesses, or community groups

## How Tutorwise Tracks Referrals

Tutorwise uses multiple secure methods to record referrals accurately, even when users move between devices or return later.

Attribution methods may include:
- Referral links
- Secure cookies
- Device-based checks
- Manual referral code entry during signup

<CalloutBox type="tip">
These methods work together to ensure referrals are recorded fairly without requiring extra effort from users.
</CalloutBox>

### Attribution and Fairness

Once a referral is recorded:
- Attribution is protected and used for future reward calculations
- The system prevents duplicate or conflicting claims
- Tutorwise applies safeguards to ensure referrals are credited appropriately

<CalloutBox type="info">
This helps maintain trust between tutors, agents, and clients.
</CalloutBox>

## Referral Rewards (High-Level Explanation)

Referral rewards are:
- Calculated only after a paid session is completed
- Based on the booking value
- Subject to eligibility and platform rules
- Capped per transaction

<CalloutBox type="tip">
Exact reward details are visible in your dashboard.

Tutorwise may adjust or refine reward structures over time in line with platform growth and policies.
</CalloutBox>

## Delegation (Working with Partners)

Tutorwise allows tutors to collaborate with partners through delegation.

Delegation lets a tutor choose to share referral rewards with an organisation or partner they work with.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Key Points:**
- Delegation can be set at profile level
- A specific listing can override the profile setting
- Listing-level delegation always takes priority
- Delegation does not override third-party referral attribution

This allows flexible partnerships without breaking referral integrity.
</CalloutBox>

## Delegation Setup Guide

### Setting Profile Default Delegation

**Use case:** You want all your referral commissions to go to a marketing partner.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Account](/account) → Referral Preferences
2. Click "Set Default Delegation"
3. Enter partner's referral code
4. Verify partner exists
5. Click "Save Default"

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Result:** All future client referrals (where you're the tutor) will pay commission to your partner.
</CalloutBox>

### Setting Listing-Specific Delegation

**Use case:** You want a specific coffee shop to earn from your Math listing.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Listings](/listings)
2. Click "Edit" on your Math listing
3. Scroll to "Delegation Settings"
4. Enter coffee shop's referral code
5. Click "Save Listing"

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Result:** Clients who scan your Math QR code at that coffee shop will pay commission to the shop (overriding profile default).
</CalloutBox>

### Finding Partners to Delegate To

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Good delegation partners:**
- Coffee shops with student clientele
- Community centers
- School administrators
- Educational bloggers
- Social media influencers in education
</CalloutBox>

**How to find their referral code:**
- Ask them directly
- They can find it in [Referrals](/referrals) dashboard
- Format: 7 characters (e.g., `ABC1234`)

## Referral Tips

<CalloutBox type="tip">
- Share your referral link in WhatsApp groups or client communities
- Print QR codes for offline promotion
- Recommend tutors you trust — successful bookings lead to rewards
- Track performance regularly from your dashboard
</CalloutBox>

## Payments, Clearing & Withdrawals

- Referral rewards appear as pending until the booking is completed
- After the clearing period, rewards become available
- Withdrawals are processed through Stripe
- Refunds, cancellations, or disputes may affect pending rewards

<CalloutBox type="info">
Full payment details are available in your account settings.
</CalloutBox>

## Important Notes

<CalloutBox type="warning">
- Referral rewards are only paid on completed, paid sessions

</CalloutBox>

Tutorwise referrals are designed to be:
- Simple to use
- Fair and transparent
- Suitable for online and offline sharing
- Supportive of long-term collaboration

<CalloutBox type="success">

#### Example 4: Tutor Recommends Another Tutor to a Client

A maths tutor recommends an English tutor.

```
Maths Tutor (Agent)
        │ recommends
        ▼
Client books English Tutor
        │

   │
┌───┼────┐
▼   ▼    ▼
Tutor A Tutor B Tutor C
```

**Steps:**

1. A client signs up via a referral
2. The client books Tutor A
3. Later, the same client books Tutor B and Tutor C
4. Tutorwise evaluates referral rewards per completed booking

### 3. Offline & Delayed Behaviour

Real referrals don't always convert immediately.

#### Example 6: Offline Introduction, Online Booking Later

```
Offline conversation
        │
        ▼
Client later signs up
        │
        ▼
Client books lesson
        │
        ▼
Lesson completed → Rewards allocated
```

**Steps:**

1. An agent mentions Tutorwise in person
2. The client signs up later
3. The client books and pays for a lesson
4. The lesson is completed
5. Tutorwise allocates referral rewards

<CalloutBox type="tip">
Tutorwise tracks referrals even when users return days or weeks later!
</CalloutBox>

#### Example 7: Client Returns Days or Weeks Later

```
Day 1: Click referral link
Day 10: Sign up
Day 14: Book lesson
Day 21: Lesson completed → Reward
```

**Steps:**

1. A client clicks a referral link
2. The client leaves without signing up
3. The client returns days or weeks later
4. The client signs up and books
5. After lesson completion, rewards are allocated

#### Example 8: Manual Referral Code Entry

  │
  ▼
Future bookings → Rewards
```

**Steps:**

1. A client or tutor signs up
2. They manually enter a referral code
3. Tutorwise records the referral
4. Future completed lessons trigger rewards

### 4. Delegation & Partnerships

Used by agencies, schools, and organised groups.

#### Example 9: Tutor Delegates Rewards to an Organisation

```
Tutor
  │ delegates rewards
  ▼
Organisation receives rewards
```

**Steps:**

1. A tutor enables delegation
2. Referral rewards are assigned to the organisation
3. Tutorwise pays the organisation instead of the tutor

#### Example 10: Organisation Promoting Multiple Tutors

```
Organisation QR Code
        │
        ▼
Clients & Tutors sign up
        │
        ▼
Bookings completed
        │
        ▼
Rewards allocated to organisation
```

**Steps:**

1. An organisation shares a referral QR code
2. Clients and tutors sign up
3. Lessons are booked and completed
4. Tutorwise allocates rewards to the organisation

### 5. Fairness & Conflict Resolution

Tutorwise avoids duplication and abuse.

#### Example 11: Multiple Recommendations, One Booking

```
Agent A   Agent B   Agent C
     \      |      /
           Client
              │
              ▼
           One booking
              │
              ▼
       One reward allocated
```

**Steps:**

1. A client hears about Tutorwise from multiple agents
2. The client books a lesson
3. Tutorwise determines the eligible referral
4. Only one reward is allocated

<CalloutBox type="info">
Tutorwise ensures fair attribution when multiple referrals are involved.
</CalloutBox>

#### Example 12: Referral After Account Creation

```
Client signs up
      │
Later receives referral
      │
Future booking → Reward allocated
```

**Steps:**

1. A client signs up without a referral
2. The client later receives a referral link or code
3. Future bookings are evaluated for rewards

### 6. Role Flexibility

Users can change how they participate.

#### Example 13: Client Becomes an Agent Later

```
Client
  │ shares referral
  ▼
New users sign up
  │
  ▼
Lessons completed → Rewards
```

**Steps:**

1. A client signs up and uses Tutorwise
2. The client later shares a referral link
3. New users sign up and book lessons
4. Tutorwise allocates referral rewards

#### Example 14: Mixed Role Interaction

```
Agent
  │
Tutor ──▶ Client ──▶ Booking
```

**Steps:**

1. An agent introduces Tutorwise
2. A tutor engages a client
3. The client books a lesson
4. The lesson is completed
5. Tutorwise allocates rewards correctly

## Simple Mental Model (Remember This)

```
Introduce Tutorwise
        │
Someone joins or books
        │
Lesson completed
        │
Reward allocated
```
