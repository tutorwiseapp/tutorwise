# How to Create Your First Listing

Your listing is how students discover you. A great listing attracts more bookings and builds trust.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**First Time?** Creating a listing takes about 10-15 minutes. You can always edit it later!
</CalloutBox>

## What is a Listing?

A listing represents a subject or service you offer. You can create multiple listings for different subjects (e.g., "GCSE Mathematics", "A-Level Physics", "Primary English").

### Why Multiple Listings?

- **Better Targeting**: Students search by specific subjects
- **Custom Pricing**: Different rates for different subjects/levels
- **Clear Expertise**: Showcase specialized knowledge

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Pro Tip**: Start with 1-2 listings for your strongest subjects, then add more as you grow.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 1: Access the Create Listing Page

1. Go to your [Dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Click "Create Listing" in the top menu
3. Or navigate to [Listings](/listings) → "New Listing"

## Step 2: Choose Your Subject & Level

### Select Subject

Pick the subject you'll teach:
- Mathematics
- English
- Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
- Languages (French, Spanish, Mandarin)
- Humanities (History, Geography)
- Computer Science
- Music, Art, Drama
- And many more...

### Select Level

Be specific about the level:
- **Primary** (KS1, KS2)
- **Secondary** (KS3, KS4/GCSE)
- **Sixth Form** (A-Level, IB)
- **University** (Undergraduate, Postgraduate)
- **Adult Learning**

<CalloutBox type="warning">
**Important**: Only list subjects and levels where you have genuine expertise. Authenticity builds trust!
</CalloutBox>

## Step 3: Set Your Pricing

### Hourly Rate

Consider these factors:
- **Your Qualifications**: Higher degrees = higher rates
- **Experience**: Years teaching and success stories
- **Subject Demand**: High-demand subjects (e.g., STEM) command premium rates
- **Competition**: Research similar tutors in your area

### Typical Rates by Level

  <Tab label="Primary">
    **Primary (Ages 5-11)**
    - Typical Range: £15-25/hour
    - Average: £20/hour

  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Secondary">
    **Secondary/GCSE (Ages 11-16)**
    - Typical Range: £20-35/hour
    - Average: £27/hour

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Tip**: Students love package deals! They book more sessions upfront and commit to regular learning.
</CalloutBox>

## Step 4: Write a Compelling Title

Your title appears in search results - make it count!

### Good Title Examples

**"GCSE Mathematics - Expert Tutor with 98% A*/A Rate"**
**"A-Level Biology - Oxbridge Graduate, 10+ Years Experience"**
**"Primary English & Phonics - Patient, Engaging Teacher"**
**"Spanish Conversation - Native Speaker, All Levels"**

### Bad Title Examples

"Maths Tutor" (Too generic)
"Best Tutor Ever!" (Unprofessional)
"Cheap Lessons Available" (Undermines value)

### Title Formula

```
[Subject] - [Your Unique Value Proposition]
```

## Step 5: Write Your Description

This is your elevator pitch! Students read this to decide if you're the right fit.

### What to Include

**Paragraph 1: Hook & Credentials**
- Start with your strongest qualification
- Mention years of experience
- State your success rate (if impressive)

Example:
> "Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm a qualified teacher with 12 years of experience teaching GCSE Mathematics. My students consistently achieve A*/A grades, with a 95% success rate over the past 5 years."

**Paragraph 2: Teaching Approach**
- Explain your teaching style
- What makes you different?
- How do you help students succeed?

Example:
> "I believe every student can excel in maths with the right approach. I use real-world examples, visual aids, and practice questions to make complex concepts click. My sessions are friendly, patient, and tailored to your learning style."

**Paragraph 3: What Students Get**
- Session structure
- Materials provided
- Follow-up support

Example:
> "Each session includes personalized lesson plans, practice worksheets, and exam-style questions. I provide homework after each session and offer email support between lessons for quick questions."

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Writing Tip**: Use "you" language to speak directly to students. Be warm, professional, and confident (not arrogant).
</CalloutBox>

## Step 6: Add Session Details

### Session Types

Choose what you offer:
- **Online Only**: Video sessions (most flexible)
- **In-Person Only**: Face-to-face at your location or student's
- **Both**: Maximum reach and flexibility

### Session Duration

Offer multiple options:
- 30 minutes (quick help, younger students)
- 1 hour (standard, most popular)
- 1.5 hours (intensive, A-Level)
- 2 hours (deep dives, exam prep)

### Location (In-Person)

If offering in-person:
- Your home/office
- Student's home
- Public library
- Café (quiet areas)

Set travel radius (e.g., "Within 5 miles of Bristol city centre")

## Step 7: Set Your Availability

### Regular Availability

Set your typical teaching hours:
- **Weekday Evenings**: 4pm-8pm (most popular)
- **Weekends**: 9am-5pm
- **Flexible**: Early mornings, lunch breaks

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Tip**: Students often search for evenings and weekends. Make sure you have some availability during these peak times!
</CalloutBox>

### Calendar Integration

- Sync with Google Calendar
- Auto-block personal commitments
- Students see real-time availability

## Step 8: Add Supporting Materials

### Upload Resources (Optional)

Show your expertise:
- Sample lesson plans
- Student testimonials
- Past exam results (anonymized)
- Educational certificates

### Video Introduction (Recommended)

Record a 30-60 second video:
- Introduce yourself
- Explain your teaching style
- Show enthusiasm and personality

**Students are 3x more likely to book tutors with video introductions!**

## Step 9: Review & Publish

### Before Publishing, Check:

- No spelling or grammar errors
- Pricing is competitive but fair
- Description is clear and compelling
- Availability shows at least 10 hours/week
- All required fields completed

### Publishing

2. Make final adjustments
3. Click "Publish"
4. Your listing goes live immediately!

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Congratulations!** Your listing is now visible to thousands of students searching for tutors!
</CalloutBox>

## After Publishing

### Optimize for Success

**Week 1: Monitor Performance**
- Check how many views your listing gets
- Track booking requests
- Read where students found you

**Week 2-4: Iterate**
- Update title if low views
- Adjust pricing if no bookings
- Add more detail to description
- Upload video if you haven't

**Ongoing: Build Reputation**
- Deliver excellent sessions
- Ask happy students for reviews
- Keep availability updated
- Respond quickly to inquiries

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Expensive for Credentials**: £50/hour but no qualifications listed
**Vague Descriptions**: "I'm a good tutor, contact me to learn more"
**Limited Availability**: Only 2 hours/week won't get bookings
**No Response to Inquiries**: Reply within 24 hours (faster is better!)
**Outdated Calendar**: Keep availability current or students lose trust
