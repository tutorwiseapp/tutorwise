## Troubleshooting

**Q: My dashboard looks different from the screenshots. Why?**
A: Dashboards adapt to your role (Tutor/Client/Agent) and activity level. New users see simplified views.

**Q: How often does the dashboard update?**
A: Real-time for most data. Earnings and analytics refresh every 5 minutes.

**Q: Can I export dashboard data?**
A: Yes! Most widgets have export options. Look for the download icon or go to the detailed view.

**Q: The dashboard is loading slowly. What can I do?**
A: Try:
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Use fewer widgets
- Check internet connection

**Q: Can I set a custom home page instead of the dashboard?**
A: Not currently. Dashboard is the default landing page for all users.
