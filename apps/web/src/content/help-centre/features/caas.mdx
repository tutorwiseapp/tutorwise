# How Credibility Score (CaaS) Works

Your Credibility Score is a 0-100 rating that shows parents, students, and other users how trustworthy, professional, and experienced you are on Tutorwise.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**What is CaaS?** Credibility as a Service (CaaS) is Tutorwise's proprietary scoring system that evaluates tutors, agents and clients (parents/guardians) across multiple trust categories.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is a Credibility Score?

Your Credibility Score appears prominently on your profile and in search results. It helps:

- **Clients (Parents & Guardians)**: Find trustworthy, qualified tutors for their children/students quickly
- **Tutors**: Build reputation, stand out in search, and demonstrate teaching quality
- **Agents (Agencies & Schools)**: Showcase organisational credibility and attract clients
- **Platform**: Maintain high quality and trust standards across the marketplace

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Higher scores = more bookings!** Tutors with scores above 70 receive 3x more booking requests than those below 50.
</CalloutBox>

## How Scores Are Calculated

### For Tutors (6-Bucket Model)

Tutor credibility is calculated across six weighted categories:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Performance">
    **Performance & Quality**

    Based on your teaching track record:

    - **Average Rating**: Star rating from completed sessions
      - Higher ratings contribute more to your score
      - Consistently high ratings show teaching quality

    - **Client Retention**: Percentage of repeat bookings
      - High retention shows student satisfaction
      - Indicates effective teaching and relationship building

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **New Tutor Advantage:** If you haven't completed any sessions yet, you receive full provisional performance points. This ensures new tutors with strong qualifications aren't penalised for being new to the platform.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Qualifications">
    **Qualifications & Authority**

    Based on your education and expertise:

    - **Degree Level**:
      - Having a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree
      - Demonstrates academic achievement

    - **Teaching Certifications**:
      - QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) - UK teaching qualification
      - Professional teaching certifications
      - Shows formal teaching training

    - **Teaching Experience**:
      - Years of teaching experience
      - More experience contributes to higher scores
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Network">
    **Network & Referrals**

    Based on your professional connections:

    - **Outgoing Referrals**:
      - Number of tutors you've successfully referred
      - Shows you're helping grow the community

    - **Agent Referrals & Connections**:
      - Being referred by verified agents/organisations
      - Having 10+ professional connections on platform
      - Provides third-party validation and community engagement
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Safety">
    **Verification & Safety**

    Based on verification and safeguarding:

    - **Identity Verification**:
      - Government-issued ID verification
      - Essential for platform trust and unlocks all other points

    - **DBS Check**:
      - Valid enhanced or standard DBS check
      - Disclosure and Barring Service (UK background check)
      - Must be current (not expired)

    <CalloutBox type="warning">
    **Safety Gate:** You must have identity verification to earn any credibility points. Without it, your score is locked at 0.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Digital">
    **Digital Professionalism**

    Based on your tech integration and engagement:

    - **Calendar Integration**:
      - Google Calendar sync
      - Google Classroom integration
      - Shows professional organization

    - **Platform Engagement**:
      - Consistently logging session data
      - OR uploading a professional bio video ("Credibility Clip")
      - Shows commitment to quality and transparency
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Social Impact">
    **Social Impact & Community**

    Based on your contribution to educational access:

    - **Free Help Availability**:
      - Enabling "Offer Free Help" on your profile
      - Making yourself discoverable for free sessions
      - Shows commitment to educational equity

    - **Free Sessions Delivered**:
      - Number of completed free help sessions
      - Each session contributes to your score
      - Creates positive impact while building credibility

    <CalloutBox type="success">
    **Win-Win:** Offering free help builds your credibility score while helping students who need it most. Many tutors find that free sessions lead to paid bookings from grateful families.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### For Clients (3-Bucket Model)

<CalloutBox type="info">
Client scoring is simpler and focuses on being a trustworthy, reliable booking partner for tutors.
</CalloutBox>

**Identity Verification**:
- Government-issued ID verification
- Strongest trust signal for tutors
- Shows you're a real, verified person

**Booking History**:
- Number of completed bookings
- Progressive scoring based on booking count
- Demonstrates reliability and engagement

**Profile Completeness**:
- Having a detailed bio (50+ characters)
- Uploading a profile photo
- Shows engagement and transparency

### For Agents (4-Bucket Model with Subscription Incentives)

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Agent CaaS is Live!** Agents now have their own credibility score based on recruitment quality, business operations, and professional standards.
</CalloutBox>

Agent credibility is calculated across four weighted categories, with **base points (70 max)** and **organisation subscription bonuses (+30 max)** for a total of 100 points:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Team Quality">
    **Bucket 1: Team Quality & Development (35 points max)**

    - **Base Points (25 max)**: Average CaaS score of tutors you've recruited
      - Higher quality tutors = higher score
      - Quality over quantity approach
      - Progressive scaling based on team average

    - **Organisation Bonus (+10 points)**: Unlocked with active organisation subscription
      - Team integration and development
      - Member quality improvement tracking
      - Organisation average CaaS contribution

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **Quality Focus:** Recruiting one excellent tutor (CaaS 85+) contributes more than five mediocre tutors. Support your recruits to succeed.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Business Operations">
    **Bucket 2: Business Operations & Scale (30 points max)**

    - **Base Points (20 max)**: Performance metrics of recruited tutors
      - Average rating of recruited tutors
      - Total sessions completed by your network
      - 6-month retention rate

    - **Organisation Bonus (+10 points)**: Unlocked with active organisation subscription
      - Brand presence (org page bookings)
      - Client acquisition via organisation
      - Internal referral collaboration rate

    <CalloutBox type="tip">
    **Synergy Effect:** When you create an organisation, your recruited tutors' success benefits both your Agent CaaS and Organisation CaaS scores.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Growth">
    **Bucket 3: Growth & Expansion (20 points max)**

    - **Base Points (15 max)**: Recruitment activity and diversity
      - Total number of recruited tutors
      - Recent recruitment (90-day activity)
      - Subject diversity across your network

    - **Organisation Bonus (+5 points)**: Unlocked with active organisation subscription
      - Current team size
      - Growth momentum (new members in 90 days)
      - Geographic expansion (service areas)

    <CalloutBox type="success">
    **Scale Strategically:** Consistent recruitment across multiple subjects and locations demonstrates professional agency operations.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Standards">
    **Bucket 4: Professional Standards (15 points max)**

    - **Base Points (10 max)**: Personal credentials
      - Identity verification (3 base points - required)
      - DBS check
      - Professional insurance
      - Association membership

    - **Organisation Bonus (+5 points)**: Unlocked with active organisation subscription
      - Business verification status
      - Organisational safeguarding certification
      - Organisation insurance coverage

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **Safety First:** Identity verification is a hard requirement. Without it, your Agent CaaS is locked at 0.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Subscription Incentive Structure:**

| Subscription Status | Maximum Score | Bonus Buckets |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Free Tier** | 70 points | Base points only |
| **Active Organisation** | 100 points | Base + Org bonuses |

Having an active organisation subscription (status = 'active' or 'trialing') unlocks an additional 30 points across all four buckets, incentivizing agents to build professional teams.

**Important Distinction:**

If you're an agent who owns an organisation, you have **TWO separate credibility scores**:

1. **Your Agent CaaS** (personal): Based on recruitment performance → stored in `caas_scores` table
2. **Your Organisation CaaS** (entity): Based on team performance → see next section

Both scores are visible on different parts of the platform and serve different purposes.

### For Organisations (Team-Based Scoring)

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Organisation CaaS is Live!** Organisations now have credibility scores based on team quality and verification status.
</CalloutBox>

Organisation credibility scoring is fundamentally different from individual scoring - it's an **entity-based score** that reflects your team's collective performance.

**Scoring Model:**

**Base Score: Weighted Team Average**
- Average CaaS score of all active team members
- Weighted by member activity (active tutors contribute more)
- Based on sessions completed in last 90 days
- Minimum 3 active members required for valid score

**Verification Bonuses:**
- Business Verified: +2 points
- Safeguarding Certified: +2 points
- Professional Insurance: +1 point
- Association Member: +1 point

**Total Possible:** Up to 106 points (100 base + 6 bonus)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Team of 5 tutors:
- Tutor A: CaaS 85 (20 sessions in 90d) → High activity weight
- Tutor B: CaaS 78 (15 sessions in 90d) → Medium activity weight
- Tutor C: CaaS 90 (25 sessions in 90d) → High activity weight
- Tutor D: CaaS 65 (5 sessions in 90d) → Low activity weight
- Tutor E: CaaS 72 (0 sessions in 90d) → Not counted (inactive)

Weighted Average: ~82/100
Business Verified: +2
Safeguarding Certified: +2
Professional Insurance: +1

Final Organisation CaaS: 87/100
```

**How Organisation CaaS Updates:**

Your organisation score recalculates automatically when:
- Team members join or leave
- Member CaaS scores change
- Verification statuses update
- Activity patterns shift (every 90 days)

**Where Organisation Scores Are Stored:**

Unlike individual profiles, organisation scores are stored directly in the `connection_groups` table's `caas_score` column (not in the `caas_scores` table).

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Synergy Effect:** Strong organisations attract high-credibility tutors, which further boosts organisation credibility - creating a positive growth cycle.

## Credibility for Organisations

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Organisation CaaS is Live!** Organisations now have their own credibility scores based on team performance and professional verification.
</CalloutBox>

Organisation credibility is calculated using an **entity-based scoring model** that's fundamentally different from individual profile scoring:

### How Organisation Scores Work

**Base Score: Activity-Weighted Team Average**

Your organisation's base score is the weighted average of your active team members' CaaS scores:

1. **Calculate Individual Scores**: Each team member has their own CaaS score (Tutor, Client, Agent, or Student)
2. **Apply Activity Weighting**: Members are weighted by their session activity in the last 90 days
   - High activity (20+ sessions): Full weight
   - Medium activity (10-19 sessions): Moderate weight
   - Low activity (1-9 sessions): Reduced weight
   - Inactive (0 sessions): Not counted
3. **Compute Weighted Average**: Activity-weighted average of all active members
4. **Minimum Requirement**: Need at least 3 active members for a valid score

**Verification Bonuses**

Organisations can earn bonus points for professional credentials:

- **Business Verified** (+2 points): Government-registered business
- **Safeguarding Certified** (+2 points): Enhanced DBS checks for all team members
- **Professional Insurance** (+1 point): Public liability and professional indemnity
- **Association Member** (+1 point): Educational association membership (e.g., ISA, NAHT)

**Total Scoring Range**: 0-106 points (100 base + up to 6 bonus)

### Example Score Calculation

```
Cambridge Tutoring Academy (8 team members):

Active Members (5):
- Sarah (Tutor): CaaS 92, 30 sessions → Weight: 1.0
- James (Tutor): CaaS 85, 18 sessions → Weight: 0.8
- Emily (Tutor): CaaS 88, 22 sessions → Weight: 1.0
- Tom (Client): CaaS 70, 8 sessions → Weight: 0.4
- Lisa (Agent): CaaS 78, 12 sessions → Weight: 0.6

Inactive Members (3):
- Mark (Tutor): CaaS 65, 0 sessions → Not counted
- Rachel (Tutor): CaaS 74, 0 sessions → Not counted
- David (Client): CaaS 55, 0 sessions → Not counted

Weighted Average Calculation:
(92×1.0 + 85×0.8 + 88×1.0 + 70×0.4 + 78×0.6) / (1.0 + 0.8 + 1.0 + 0.4 + 0.6)
= 338.8 / 3.8
= 89.2

Bonuses:
+ Business Verified: +2
+ Safeguarding Certified: +2
+ Professional Insurance: +1

Final Organisation CaaS: 94/100
```

### When Scores Update

Organisation scores recalculate automatically:
- **Real-time**: When team members join or leave
- **Hourly**: When member individual scores change
- **Daily**: When activity weighting shifts (90-day rolling window)
- **On-demand**: When verification status updates

### Benefits of High Organisation CaaS

**For the Organisation:**
- Higher visibility in search results
- Featured in "Top Organisations" lists
- Premium pricing justified
- Easier tutor recruitment
- Client trust and credibility

**For Team Members:**
- Benefit from organisation's reputation
- Higher booking conversion
- Professional development support
- Collaborative success

**For Clients:**
- Confidence in team quality
- Consistent service standards
- Multiple tutor options
- Professional accountability

### Improving Your Organisation Score

**Short-Term (1-3 Months):**
1. Help existing tutors improve their individual CaaS scores
2. Complete business verification
3. Obtain professional insurance
4. Remove inactive team members (if permanently inactive)
5. Encourage active tutors to complete more sessions

**Long-Term (3-12 Months):**
1. Recruit high-quality tutors (CaaS 70+)
2. Provide professional development training
3. Achieve safeguarding certification for all members
4. Join educational associations
5. Build consistent team performance culture

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Strategic Insight:** Focus on quality over quantity. An organisation with 5 highly active tutors (CaaS 85+) will score higher than one with 20 inactive tutors (CaaS 60).
</CalloutBox>

### Organisation vs Agent CaaS

**Important:** If you're an agent who owns an organisation, you have **two separate scores**:

| Aspect | Agent CaaS | Organisation CaaS |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **What it measures** | Your recruitment quality | Your team's performance |
| **Scored as** | Profile (individual) | Entity (organisation) |
| **Storage** | `caas_scores` table | `connection_groups.caas_score` |
| **Factors** | Tutors recruited, business ops | Team quality, verifications |
| **Updates** | When you recruit/manage | When team performs/changes |
| **Visibility** | Your personal profile | Organisation page |

Both scores are valuable and serve different purposes - your Agent CaaS shows your recruitment expertise, while Organisation CaaS shows your team's quality.

Learn more about [Organisations](/help-centre/features/organisations) and team management.

## Common Questions

**Why is my score 0?**
- You likely haven't completed identity verification
- This is the Safety Gate requirement
- Complete ID verification to unlock scoring

**Why did my score drop?**
- Old DBS certificate expired
- Recent low-rating sessions
- Integration disconnected (calendar, etc.)
- Account inactivity penalty

- Inflated qualifications are flagged
- Focus on genuine improvement instead

**How long to reach 70+ score?**
- New tutors: 3-6 months with active teaching
- With existing qualifications: 1-3 months
- Depends on completion of verifications and sessions
- Focus on quick wins first, then build over time

**Does my score affect pricing?**
- Not directly, but indirectly yes
- High-credibility tutors can charge premium rates
- Students willing to pay more for trusted tutors
- Price according to your value proposition

## Tips from High-Credibility Tutors

**Sarah M. (Score: 94) - GCSE Maths**
> "I focused on the quick wins first - ID verification, calendar sync, and completing my profile. Then I delivered great sessions and let the performance build naturally. Took about 4 months to reach 90+."

**James T. (Score: 87) - A-Level Physics**
> "Getting my DBS was worth every penny. Not only did it add 5 points, but parents specifically mentioned feeling safer booking with me. It's a trust signal beyond just the score."

**Emily R. (Score: 91) - Primary English**
> "I offer one free help session per month. It adds credibility points, helps the community, and often leads to paid bookings. Win-win-win!"
