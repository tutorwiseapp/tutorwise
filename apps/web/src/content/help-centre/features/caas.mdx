# How Credibility Score (CaaS) Works

Your Credibility Score is a 0-100 rating that shows students and clients how trustworthy, professional, and experienced you are on Tutorwise.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**What is CaaS?** Credibility as a Service (CaaS) is Tutorwise's proprietary scoring system that evaluates tutors and clients across multiple trust dimensions.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is a Credibility Score?

Your Credibility Score appears prominently on your profile and in search results. It helps:

- **Students**: Find trustworthy, qualified tutors quickly
- **Tutors**: Build reputation and stand out in search
- **Clients**: Demonstrate they're reliable booking partners
- **Platform**: Maintain high quality and trust standards

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Higher scores = more bookings!** Tutors with scores above 70 receive 3x more booking requests than those below 50.
</CalloutBox>

## How Scores Are Calculated

### For Tutors (6-Bucket Model)

Tutor credibility is calculated across six weighted categories:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Performance">
    **Performance & Quality**

    Based on your teaching track record:

    - **Average Rating**: Star rating from completed sessions
      - Higher ratings contribute more to your score
      - Consistently high ratings show teaching quality

    - **Client Retention**: Percentage of repeat bookings
      - High retention shows student satisfaction
      - Indicates effective teaching and relationship building

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **New Tutor Advantage:** If you haven't completed any sessions yet, you receive full provisional performance points. This ensures new tutors with strong qualifications aren't penalized for being new to the platform.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Qualifications">
    **Qualifications & Authority**

    Based on your education and expertise:

    - **Degree Level**:
      - Having a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree
      - Demonstrates academic achievement

    - **Teaching Certifications**:
      - QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) - UK teaching qualification
      - Professional teaching certifications
      - Shows formal teaching training

    - **Teaching Experience**:
      - Years of teaching experience
      - More experience contributes to higher scores
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Network">
    **Network & Referrals**

    Based on your professional connections:

    - **Outgoing Referrals**:
      - Number of tutors you've successfully referred
      - Shows you're helping grow the community

    - **Agent Referrals & Connections**:
      - Being referred by verified agents/organisations
      - Having 10+ professional connections on platform
      - Provides third-party validation and community engagement
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Safety">
    **Verification & Safety**

    Based on verification and safeguarding:

    - **Identity Verification**:
      - Government-issued ID verification
      - Essential for platform trust and unlocks all other points

    - **DBS Check**:
      - Valid enhanced or standard DBS check
      - Disclosure and Barring Service (UK background check)
      - Must be current (not expired)

    <CalloutBox type="warning">
    **Safety Gate:** You must have identity verification to earn any credibility points. Without it, your score is locked at 0.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Digital">
    **Digital Professionalism**

    Based on your tech integration and engagement:

    - **Calendar Integration**:
      - Google Calendar sync
      - Google Classroom integration
      - Shows professional organization

    - **Platform Engagement**:
      - Consistently logging session data
      - OR uploading a professional bio video ("Credibility Clip")
      - Shows commitment to quality and transparency
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Social Impact">
    **Social Impact & Community**

    Based on your contribution to educational access:

    - **Free Help Availability**:
      - Enabling "Offer Free Help" on your profile
      - Making yourself discoverable for free sessions
      - Shows commitment to educational equity

    - **Free Sessions Delivered**:
      - Number of completed free help sessions
      - Each session contributes to your score
      - Creates positive impact while building credibility

    <CalloutBox type="success">
    **Win-Win:** Offering free help builds your credibility score while helping students who need it most. Many tutors find that free sessions lead to paid bookings from grateful families.
