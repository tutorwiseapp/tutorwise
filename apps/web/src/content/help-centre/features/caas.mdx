# How Credibility Score (CaaS) Works

Your Credibility Score is a 0-100 rating that shows parents, students, and other users how trustworthy, professional, and experienced you are on Tutorwise.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**What is CaaS?** Credibility as a Service (CaaS) is Tutorwise's proprietary scoring system that evaluates tutors, agents and clients (parents/guardians) across multiple trust categories.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is a Credibility Score?

Your Credibility Score appears prominently on your profile and in search results. It helps:

- **Clients (Parents & Guardians)**: Find trustworthy, qualified tutors for their children/students quickly
- **Tutors**: Build reputation, stand out in search, and demonstrate teaching quality
- **Agents (Agencies & Schools)**: Showcase organisational credibility and attract clients
- **Platform**: Maintain high quality and trust standards across the marketplace

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Higher scores = more bookings!** Tutors with scores above 70 receive 3x more booking requests than those below 50.
</CalloutBox>

## How Scores Are Calculated

### Universal 6-Bucket Model (All Roles)

<CalloutBox type="success">
**v6.1 Update**: All roles (Tutors, Clients, Agents) now use the same 6-bucket model for fairness and consistency. Same categories, role-specific metrics.
</CalloutBox>

Credibility is calculated across six weighted categories:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Delivery (40%)">
    **Delivery & Quality**

    Based on your core value delivery on the platform:

    - **Average Rating**: Star rating from completed sessions
      - Higher ratings contribute more to your score
      - Consistently high ratings show teaching quality

    - **Client Retention**: Percentage of repeat bookings
      - High retention shows student satisfaction
      - Indicates effective teaching and relationship building

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **New Tutor Advantage:** If you haven't completed any sessions yet, you receive full provisional performance points. This ensures new tutors with strong qualifications aren't penalised for being new to the platform.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Credentials (20%)">
    **Credentials & Expertise**

    Based on your qualifications and professional profile:

    - **Degree Level**:
      - Having a Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD degree
      - Demonstrates academic achievement

    - **Teaching Certifications**:
      - QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) - UK teaching qualification
      - Professional teaching certifications
      - Shows formal teaching training

    - **Teaching Experience**:
      - Years of teaching experience
      - More experience contributes to higher scores
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Network (15%)">
    **Network & Connections**

    Based on your professional network and referrals (all roles can make AND receive referrals):

    - **Outgoing Referrals**:
      - Number of tutors you've successfully referred
      - Shows you're helping grow the community

    - **Agent Referrals & Connections**:
      - Being referred by verified agents/organisations
      - Having 10+ professional connections on platform
      - Provides third-party validation and community engagement
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Trust (10%)">
    **Trust & Verification**

    Based on your verification status:

    - **Identity Verification**: Government-issued ID verification
    - **Proof of Address**: Utility bill or bank statement
    - **DBS Check**: Valid enhanced or standard DBS check (UK background check)
    - **Business Verification**: For agents and organisations

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **Provisional Scoring (v6.1):** You no longer need identity verification to get a score! Complete onboarding to get a provisional score (70% multiplier). Verify your identity to boost to 85%, then complete all verifications for 100% multiplier.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Digital (10%)">
    **Digital Integration**

    Based on your platform integration and professional tools:

    - **Calendar Integration**:
      - Google Calendar sync
      - Google Classroom integration
      - Shows professional organization

    - **Platform Engagement**:
      - Consistently logging session data
      - OR uploading a professional bio video ("Credibility Clip")
      - Shows commitment to quality and transparency
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Impact (5%)">
    **Community Impact**

    Based on your contribution to education and community:

    - **Free Help Availability**:
      - Enabling "Offer Free Help" on your profile
      - Making yourself discoverable for free sessions
      - Shows commitment to educational equity

    - **Free Sessions Delivered**:
      - Number of completed free help sessions
      - Each session contributes to your score
      - Creates positive impact while building credibility

    <CalloutBox type="success">
    **Win-Win:** Offering free help builds your credibility score while helping students who need it most. Many tutors find that free sessions lead to paid bookings from grateful families.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### For Clients (3-Bucket Model)

<CalloutBox type="info">
Client scoring is simpler and focuses on being a trustworthy, reliable booking partner for tutors.
</CalloutBox>

**Identity Verification**:
- Government-issued ID verification
- Strongest trust signal for tutors
- Shows you're a real, verified person

**Booking History**:
- Number of completed bookings
- Progressive scoring based on booking count
- Demonstrates reliability and engagement

**Profile Completeness**:
- Having a detailed bio (50+ characters)
- Uploading a profile photo
- Shows engagement and transparency

### For Agents

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Agent CaaS is Live!** Agents now have their own credibility score based on recruitment quality, business operations, and professional standards.
</CalloutBox>

Agent credibility is evaluated across four key areas. Agents with active organisation subscriptions can achieve higher scores through additional credibility factors:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Team Quality">
    **Team Quality & Development**

    Based on the quality of tutors you recruit:

    - Average CaaS score of tutors you've recruited
    - Quality over quantity approach - focus on recruiting excellent tutors
    - Team integration and professional development

    **Organisation Benefit**: Active organisation subscription unlocks additional scoring for team performance metrics

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **Quality Focus:** Recruiting one excellent tutor contributes more than several mediocre tutors. Support your recruits to succeed.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Business Operations">
    **Business Operations & Scale**

    Based on your network's performance:

    - Average rating of recruited tutors
    - Total sessions completed by your network
    - Tutor retention over time
    - Brand presence and client acquisition

    **Organisation Benefit**: Active organisation subscription unlocks additional scoring for business growth metrics

    <CalloutBox type="tip">
    **Synergy Effect:** When you create an organisation, your recruited tutors' success benefits both your Agent CaaS and Organisation CaaS scores.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Growth">
    **Growth & Expansion**

    Based on recruitment activity and diversity:

    - Total number of recruited tutors
    - Recent recruitment activity
    - Subject diversity across your network
    - Team size and growth momentum

    **Organisation Benefit**: Active organisation subscription unlocks additional scoring for expansion metrics

    <CalloutBox type="success">
    **Scale Strategically:** Consistent recruitment across multiple subjects and locations demonstrates professional agency operations.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Standards">
    **Professional Standards**

    Based on your professional credentials:

    - Identity verification (required)
    - DBS check
    - Professional insurance
    - Association membership
    - Business verification status

    **Organisation Benefit**: Active organisation subscription unlocks additional scoring for organisational credentials

    <CalloutBox type="info">
    **Safety First:** Identity verification is a hard requirement. Without it, your Agent CaaS is locked at 0.
    </CalloutBox>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Organisation Subscription Benefits:**

Having an active organisation subscription unlocks additional credibility scoring across all four categories, allowing you to achieve higher overall scores by demonstrating professional team management and business operations.

**Important Distinction:**

If you're an agent who owns an organisation, you have **TWO separate credibility scores**:

1. **Your Agent CaaS** (personal): Based on your recruitment performance and professional credentials
2. **Your Organisation CaaS** (team): Based on your team's collective performance and quality

Both scores are visible on different parts of the platform and serve different purposes.

### For Organisations (Team-Based Scoring)

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Organisation CaaS is Live!** Organisations now have credibility scores based on team quality and verification status.
</CalloutBox>

Organisation credibility scoring is fundamentally different from individual scoring - it's an **entity-based score** that reflects your team's collective performance.

**How Organisation Scoring Works (0-100 points):**

**Team Performance:**
- Based on the average CaaS score of your active team members
- More active tutors (higher recent session activity) contribute more to your score
- Inactive team members don't negatively impact your score
- Minimum 3 active members required

**Professional Verification Bonuses:**
- Business verification status
- Safeguarding certification
- Professional insurance coverage
- Educational association membership

All verification credentials boost your organisation's overall credibility score.

**Automatic Updates:**

Your organisation score recalculates automatically when:
- Team members join or leave
- Member CaaS scores change
- Verification statuses update
- Activity patterns shift

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Synergy Effect:** Strong organisations attract high-credibility tutors, which further boosts organisation credibility - creating a positive growth cycle.

## Credibility for Organisations

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Organisation CaaS is Live!** Organisations now have their own credibility scores based on team performance and professional verification.
</CalloutBox>

Organisation credibility is calculated using an **entity-based scoring model** that's fundamentally different from individual profile scoring:

### How Organisation Scores Work

**Base Score: Activity-Weighted Team Average**

Your organisation's base score is the weighted average of your active team members' CaaS scores:

1. **Calculate Individual Scores**: Each team member has their own CaaS score (Tutor, Client, Agent, or Student)
2. **Apply Activity Weighting**: Members are weighted by their session activity in the last 90 days
   - High activity (20+ sessions): Full weight
   - Medium activity (10-19 sessions): Moderate weight
   - Low activity (1-9 sessions): Reduced weight
   - Inactive (0 sessions): Not counted
3. **Compute Weighted Average**: Activity-weighted average of all active members
4. **Minimum Requirement**: Need at least 3 active members for a valid score

**Verification Bonuses**

Organisations can earn bonus points for professional credentials:

- **Business Verified** (+2 points): Government-registered business
- **Safeguarding Certified** (+2 points): Enhanced DBS checks for all team members
- **Professional Insurance** (+1 point): Public liability and professional indemnity
- **Association Member** (+1 point): Educational association membership (e.g., ISA, NAHT)

**Total Scoring Range**: 0-106 points (100 base + up to 6 bonus)

### Example Score Calculation

```
Cambridge Tutoring Academy (8 team members):

Active Members (5):
- Sarah (Tutor): CaaS 92, 30 sessions → Weight: 1.0
- James (Tutor): CaaS 85, 18 sessions → Weight: 0.8
- Emily (Tutor): CaaS 88, 22 sessions → Weight: 1.0
- Tom (Client): CaaS 70, 8 sessions → Weight: 0.4
- Lisa (Agent): CaaS 78, 12 sessions → Weight: 0.6

Inactive Members (3):
- Mark (Tutor): CaaS 65, 0 sessions → Not counted
- Rachel (Tutor): CaaS 74, 0 sessions → Not counted
- David (Client): CaaS 55, 0 sessions → Not counted

Weighted Average Calculation:
(92×1.0 + 85×0.8 + 88×1.0 + 70×0.4 + 78×0.6) / (1.0 + 0.8 + 1.0 + 0.4 + 0.6)
= 338.8 / 3.8
= 89.2

Bonuses:
+ Business Verified: +2
+ Safeguarding Certified: +2
+ Professional Insurance: +1

Final Organisation CaaS: 94/100
```

### When Scores Update

Organisation scores recalculate automatically:
- **Real-time**: When team members join or leave
- **Hourly**: When member individual scores change
- **Daily**: When activity weighting shifts (90-day rolling window)
- **On-demand**: When verification status updates

### Benefits of High Organisation CaaS

**For the Organisation:**
- Higher visibility in search results
- Featured in "Top Organisations" lists
- Premium pricing justified
- Easier tutor recruitment
- Client trust and credibility

**For Team Members:**
- Benefit from organisation's reputation
- Higher booking conversion
- Professional development support
- Collaborative success

**For Clients:**
- Confidence in team quality
- Consistent service standards
- Multiple tutor options
- Professional accountability

### Improving Your Organisation Score

**Short-Term (1-3 Months):**
1. Help existing tutors improve their individual CaaS scores
2. Complete business verification
3. Obtain professional insurance
4. Remove inactive team members (if permanently inactive)
5. Encourage active tutors to complete more sessions

**Long-Term (3-12 Months):**
1. Recruit high-quality tutors (CaaS 70+)
2. Provide professional development training
3. Achieve safeguarding certification for all members
4. Join educational associations
5. Build consistent team performance culture

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Strategic Insight:** Focus on quality over quantity. An organisation with 5 highly active tutors (CaaS 85+) will score higher than one with 20 inactive tutors (CaaS 60).
</CalloutBox>

### Organisation vs Agent CaaS

**Important:** If you're an agent who owns an organisation, you have **two separate scores**:

| Aspect | Agent CaaS | Organisation CaaS |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **What it measures** | Your recruitment quality | Your team's performance |
| **Scored as** | Profile (individual) | Entity (organisation) |
| **Storage** | `caas_scores` table | `connection_groups.caas_score` |
| **Factors** | Tutors recruited, business ops | Team quality, verifications |
| **Updates** | When you recruit/manage | When team performs/changes |
| **Visibility** | Your personal profile | Organisation page |

Both scores are valuable and serve different purposes - your Agent CaaS shows your recruitment expertise, while Organisation CaaS shows your team's quality.

## Tips from High-Credibility Tutors

**Sarah M. (Score: 94) - GCSE Maths**
