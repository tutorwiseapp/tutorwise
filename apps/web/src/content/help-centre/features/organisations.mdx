# How Organisations Work on Tutorwise

Organisations allow tutoring agencies, schools, and tutoring centers to manage their teams, track performance, and collaborate effectively on Tutorwise.

<CalloutBox type="info">
**Perfect for:** Tutoring agencies, private schools, education centers, and collaborative tutor networks looking to centralize operations and grow together.
</CalloutBox>

## What Is an Organisation on Tutorwise?

An organisation is a collaborative workspace where multiple tutors can work under a unified brand. It provides:

- **Team Management**: Add tutors, set roles, and manage permissions
- **Client Aggregation**: See all clients across your team in one place
- **Performance Analytics**: Track team performance, earnings, and bookings
- **Shared Branding**: Present a unified professional identity

<CalloutBox type="tip">
Organisations are ideal when you have 3+ tutors working together or plan to grow your tutoring business beyond solo teaching.
</CalloutBox>

## Creating Your Organisation

2. Click "Organisation" in the navigation menu

</CalloutBox>

## Client Management

### Understanding Client Aggregation

The Clients tab shows all students who have booked with any team member. This gives you:

- **Complete Client List**: See everyone your team serves
- **Booking History**: Track which tutors work with which clients
- **Contact Information**: Access client details for coordination
- **Growth Tracking**: Monitor your total client base

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Privacy Note:** Client data is aggregated but tutors maintain individual client relationships. Respect data privacy and professional boundaries.
</CalloutBox>

### Viewing Client Information

**Available Data:**
- Client name and email
- Subjects they're studying
- Tutors they've booked with
- Total bookings made
- Active vs. inactive status

**Export Functionality:**
- Download CSV of all clients
- Filter by tutor, subject, or date range
- Use for marketing, reporting, or CRM integration

## Referral Pipeline & Conversion Tracking

Track and manage referrals through a visual conversion pipeline.

### Pipeline Example

The 6-stage pipeline lets you manually track referrals as you nurture them towards conversion. Here's an example:

**Example: Maths Tutor Refers English Tutor**
1. **Referred** - Sarah creates referral entry for Tom in the pipeline
2. **Contacted** - Sarah manually moves to this stage after emailing Tom about joining
3. **Meeting Set** - Sarah manually moves here after scheduling a call with Tom
4. **Proposal Sent** - Sarah manually moves here after Tom signs up and creates profile
5. **Negotiating** - Sarah manually moves here as Tom starts getting clients
6. **Won** - Automatically updates when Tom completes a paid booking (Sarah earns commission)

**Another Example: Tutor Refers Client**
1. **Referred** - Organisation member creates referral entry for potential client
2. **Contacted** - Manually moved after sending initial outreach email
3. **Meeting Set** - Manually moved after client schedules discovery call
4. **Proposal Sent** - Manually moved after sending lesson package proposal
5. **Negotiating** - Manually moved when client negotiates pricing/schedule
6. **Won** - Automatically updates when client completes first booking (commission earned)

### Managing Referrals

**Drag-and-Drop Management:**
- Go to Organisation → Referrals tab
- Drag referral cards between stages
- Track estimated value per referral
- Monitor conversion rates

**Filtering & Analytics:**
- View active referrals or historical data (30d, 90d, all-time)
- See member-specific performance
- Track drop-off rates between stages
- Time-in-stage analytics

<CalloutBox type="tip">
**Best Practice:** Move referrals to "Contacted" within 24 hours of "Referred" stage for highest conversion rates (industry benchmark: 60% when contacted within 1 day).
</CalloutBox>

### Conversion Funnel Metrics

Track your recruitment funnel health:
- Stage conversion rates (Referred → Won)
- Average days to progress each stage
- Drop-off identification
- Revenue forecasting (conservative, realistic, optimistic)

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Goal:** Aim for 30%+ conversion from Referred → Won within 30 days for healthy recruitment pipeline.
</CalloutBox>

## Gamification & Achievements

Motivate your team with achievements, streaks, and leaderboards.

## Common Organisation Scenarios

### Example 1: Small Tutoring Agency

**Brighton Tutors** has 5 tutors specializing in GCSE Maths and Science.

```
Owner creates organisation
        │
        ▼
Invites 4 tutors as Members
        │
        ▼
Clients book any available tutor
        │
        ▼
Owner tracks team performance
        │
        ▼
Agency grows based on data insights
```

**Steps:**

1. Owner sets up organisation with agency branding
2. Invites tutors with GCSE specializations
3. Clients see "Brighton Tutors" on tutor profiles
4. Agency uses analytics to identify high-demand subjects
5. Hires additional tutors for popular subjects

### Example 2: Private School

**Oxford Academy** wants to offer after-school tutoring to students.

```
School Admin creates organisation
        │
        ▼
Adds teachers as tutors (Admins)
        │
        ▼
Students book with their teachers
        │
        ▼
School tracks supplementary learning
```

**Steps:**

1. School creates Premium organisation
2. Adds 15 teachers as tutors (various subjects)
3. Promotes service to parents via school newsletter
4. Parents book directly through Tutorwise
5. School monitors which subjects need most support

### Example 3: Collaborative Tutor Network

Independent tutors form a referral network.

```
Lead Tutor creates organisation
        │
        ▼
Invites specialist tutors
        │
        ▼
Tutors refer clients to each other
        │
        ▼
Network builds collective reputation
```

**Steps:**

1. Maths tutor creates organisation "Expert Tutors Network"
2. Invites English, Science, and Languages specialists
3. When maths clients need English help, tutor refers within network
4. Organisation credibility grows with shared positive reviews
5. Network becomes trusted brand in local community

## Integrations with Other Features

### Organisations + Referrals

- Organisation members can share a unified referral code
- Referral commissions can be delegated to the organisation
- Track which tutors bring in most referrals
- Organisation earns from all member referrals (if configured)

### Organisations + Credibility Score (CaaS)

<CalloutBox type="success">
**Organisation CaaS is Live!** Your organisation now has its own credibility score separate from individual member scores.
</CalloutBox>

**How Organisation CaaS Works:**

- **Activity-Weighted Team Average**: Your score is the weighted average of active team members' CaaS scores
- **90-Day Activity Window**: Members weighted by sessions completed in last 90 days
- **Minimum 3 Active Members**: Need at least 3 active members for a valid score
- **Verification Bonuses**: Earn +2 for business verification, +2 for safeguarding, +1 for insurance, +1 for association membership
- **Auto-Updates**: Recalculates when members join/leave or scores change

**Example:**
```
5 active tutors with CaaS scores: 92, 85, 88, 70, 78
Weighted by session activity in last 90 days
Base Score: ~85/100
+ Business Verified: +2
+ Safeguarding Certified: +2
Final Organisation CaaS: 89/100
```

**Benefits:**
- Higher individual member scores boost organisation reputation
- New tutors benefit from established organisation credibility
- Clients trust organisations with proven track records (CaaS 80+)
- Featured placement in search for high-scoring organisations

**Important:** If you're an agent who owns an organisation, you have **TWO separate scores**:
1. **Your Agent CaaS** (personal): Based on your recruitment performance
2. **Your Organisation CaaS** (entity): Based on your team's quality
