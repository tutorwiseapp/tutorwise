        │
        ▼
Clients book any available tutor
        │
        ▼
Owner tracks team performance
        │
        ▼
Agency grows based on data insights
```

**Steps:**

1. Owner sets up organisation with agency branding
2. Invites tutors with GCSE specializations
3. Clients see "Brighton Tutors" on tutor profiles
