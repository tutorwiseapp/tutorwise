## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why don't I see all my students?**
A: Check your filters. Students only appear after completing at least one paid session with you.

**Q: How do I remove a student from my list?**
A: You can't remove students, but you can archive them to hide from default view.

**Q: Can students see the notes I write about them?**
A: No, session notes are completely private and only visible to you.

**Q: How do I export my student list?**
A: Click "Export" button in My Students dashboard. Downloads CSV with all data.

**Q: What if a student books with multiple tutors?**
A: They'll appear in each tutor's My Students list independently. No cross-tutor visibility.
