## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why aren't any tutors showing up for my search?**
A: Try:
- Broadening filters (remove some)
- Expanding location radius
- Increasing price range
- Different subject keywords
- "Online" instead of in-person

**Q: How do I find tutors who speak my language?**
A: Use language filter or search "[language] tutor" in search bar.

**Q: Can I search for tutors by name?**
A: Yes! Enter their name in the search bar. Useful if a friend recommended someone.

**Q: Why do some tutors show "Request" vs. "Instant Book"?**
A: Tutors choose their booking preference. "Request" means they approve each booking; "Instant Book" auto-confirms if you match their criteria.

**Q: How often is marketplace data updated?**
A: Real-time for availability. Credibility scores update within 10 minutes. New tutor profiles appear instantly.
