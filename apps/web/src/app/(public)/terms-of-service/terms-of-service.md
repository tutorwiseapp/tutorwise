6.2 Users acknowledge that the referral system, attribution mechanisms, data structures, and platform logic are owned, operated, and controlled exclusively by Tutorwise.

6.3 Participation in the referral system does not confer any ownership, licence, or rights in the referral system, algorithms, or platform architecture to any user.
