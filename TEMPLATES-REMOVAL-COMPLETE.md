## ✅ Testing Required

### Critical Test: Create New Listing
Please test the listing creation flow to confirm everything works:

1. **Login as tutor**
   - Go to: https://tutorwise.io (or your dev server)
   - Login with tutor credentials

2. **Navigate to My Listings**
   - Go to: `/my-listings`
   - You should see: "No listings yet" (expected - templates removed)

3. **Click "Create Listing"**
   - Click the "Create Listing" button
   - Wizard should load

4. **Verify Step 1 - Basic Info**
   - Click "Get Started" on welcome screen
   - You should see Step 1: Basic Information
   - **Check Full Name field:**
     - ✅ Should display your name (e.g., "Michael Quan")
     - ✅ Should NOT show "Loading..."
     - ✅ Field should be read-only/disabled (grayed out)

5. **Complete the Listing**
   - Fill in title (e.g., "A-Level Mathematics Tutor")
   - Fill in description (50+ characters)
   - Complete remaining steps
   - Publish the listing

6. **Verify Success**
   - Listing should appear in `/my-listings`
   - You should be able to edit it
   - Full name should be populated correctly

### Expected Results
- ✅ Full name displays correctly (not "Loading...")
- ✅ All wizard steps work normally
- ✅ Listing can be created and published
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ No errors in database logs

## 💡 Why This Works

Your [CreateListingWizard.tsx](apps/web/src/app/components/listings/CreateListingWizard.tsx) has **4 independent safeguards** that ensure `full_name` is always populated:

1. **Loading Guard** (lines 274-282)
   ```typescript
   if (isProfileLoading) {
     return <div>Loading your profile...</div>;
   }
   ```

2. **Initial State** (lines 46-49)
   ```typescript
   if (profile?.full_name && !baseData.full_name) {
     baseData.full_name = profile.full_name;
   }
   ```

3. **Auto-Populate Effect** (lines 98-140)
   ```typescript
   if (profile.full_name && !formData.full_name) {
     updates.full_name = profile.full_name;
   }
   ```

4. **Navigation Guard** (lines 156-159)
   ```typescript
   if (profile?.full_name && !formData.full_name) {
     setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, full_name: profile.full_name }));
   }
   ```

**Result:** Zero chance of race condition, no "Loading..." state possible.
