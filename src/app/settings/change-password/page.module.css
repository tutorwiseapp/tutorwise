 * Purpose: Provides page-specific styles for the Change Password form.
 *
 * Change History:
 * C002 - 2025-07-21 : 21:30 - Removed .container class as layout is now handled by the global Container component.
 * C001 - 2025-07-20 : 10:30 - Initial creation.
 *
 * Last Modified: 2025-07-21 : 21:30
 * Requirement ID (optional): VIN-A-005
 *
 * Change Summary:
 * The `.container` class has been removed. All layout responsibilities (like max-width and
 * padding) have been centralized into the `<Container variant="form">` component, making this
 * stylesheet empty. It is preserved for any future page-specific styling needs.
 *
 * Impact Analysis:
 * This change simplifies the CSS and improves maintainability by adhering to the
 * component-driven layout system.
 *
 * Dependencies: None.
