/*
 * Filename: src/app/api/auth/[kindeAuth]/route.ts
 * Purpose: Provides the dynamic API route handlers for the Kinde SDK.
 * Change History:
 * C004 - 2025-09-01 : 14:00 - Definitive fix for TS conflict using an explicit GET handler with a type assertion.
 * C003 - 2025-08-31 : 21:00 - Implemented explicit GET handler.
 * C001 - 2025-08-31 : 20:00 - Initial creation.
 * Last Modified: 2025-09-01 : 14:00
 * Requirement ID: VIN-AUTH-MIG-06
 * Change Summary: This is the definitive fix for the final build error. It uses the explicit `async function GET` pattern to satisfy the Next.js App Router structure. Crucially, it adds a type assertion (`as any`) to the `handleAuth` return value. This resolves the underlying TypeScript type definition conflict between the Kinde SDK and Next.js, allowing the build to succeed.
 * Impact Analysis: This change fixes the final build-blocking error and makes the authentication system fully operational.
