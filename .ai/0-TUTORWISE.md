# Tutorwise

## Description

> [!NOTE]
> The **Tutorwise Space** is a central hub for organisational information and key resources. Detailed documentation and specific content are provided in the **Strategy & Compliance**, **Business Operations**, and **Technology Operations** spaces, with shortcut links located in the left-hand menu for quick access. The naming of spaces and folders has been intentionally kept simple and relevant to align with Tutorwise’s unique structure, though it may differ from traditional industry standards.
> This Tutorwise’s space Home page is streamlined to highlight essential information, reducing distractions and enabling users to navigate to relevant sections. To maintain this simplicity, certain features have been disabled through the **Space Settings** options.
> The Confluence folder and file system has been structured to align with the DevOps Target Operating Model. For instance, the Technology Operations space follows the Agile framework with the sequence of Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Release, and Operation (Support). As a result, the Business Analysis folder contains the requirements, with hyperlinks directing users to the corresponding Architecture & Design folders and documents. Users can click on the feature requirement names in the table to access detailed product features and service design documentation.

# Strategic Purpose

## Vision

At Tutorwise, we aim **to become the global leader in education — where opportunity flows through credibility, referrals, and networks**. We create an inclusive, equitable tutoring ecosystem where trust and connection shape meaningful opportunities.

## Mission

Tutorwise’s mission is **to maximise opportunities by fostering trust, incentivising referrals, and growing connections across our global tutoring network**. We focus on user-centricity, providing features that help clients, tutors, and agents connect, collaborate, and engage seamlessly — ensuring transparency, trust, and meaningful outcomes at every step.

## Core Values

Our core values guide everything we do. They help us build meaningful connections, empower our community, and create experiences that inspire trust and inclusivity. We focus on innovation, putting users first, and making a positive impact while striving for excellence and a more connected, accessible future.

1. **Focus on the User-centric Experience**
  - We create user-driven experiences by simplifying complexity, fostering opportunities, monetising connections, and incentivising meaningful interactions.
  - *One-liner: We put user experience at the heart of every interaction.*
2. **Build Thriving Communities**
  - We build a community where everyone feels connected, valued, and empowered to achieve shared success, fostering long-term relationships and growth.
  - *One-liner: We empower communities to achieve shared success.*
3. **Commit to Excellence**
  - We commit to delivering excellence in every connection we make, every interaction we facilitate, and every experience we create, ensuring we excel in what we do best.
  - *One-liner: We deliver excellence in every experience we create.*
4. **Take Ownership**
  - We take full responsibility for our actions and outcomes, acting with pride, accountability, and a commitment to always doing better.
  - *One-liner: We take full ownership of our actions and results.*
5. **Grow Through Learning**
  - We actively seek opportunities to grow, adapt to change, and evolve, consistently enhancing the value we deliver to our community and the world.
  - *One-liner: We seize opportunities to learn and grow continuously.*
6. **Embrace Frugality**

7. **Champion Innovation**

  - *One-liner: We foster creativity and innovation to stay ahead of the curve.*

These core values form the foundation of everything we do, ensuring every decision drives our mission forward and supports a future where we create lasting impact and meaningful change.

NOTES: The first three core values—**Focus on the User Experience**, **Build Thriving Communities**, and **Commit to Excellence**—are about serving our users and empowering community through exceptional experiences. The fourth core value, **Take Ownership**, connects these user and community-focused values with the final three—**Grow Through Learning**, **Embrace Frugality**, and **Champion Innovation**—which are steered towards business growth and leadership.

Leaders who take ownership demonstrate responsibility, learn from their experiences, and adapt to challenges, ensuring resources are used efficiently (frugality) and innovation is prioritised to drive progress. This value reinforces the idea that leadership is about owning outcomes, fostering growth, and creating meaningful impact for both the community and the organisation. By taking ownership, leaders ensure that the user-centric and community-driven values are seamlessly aligned with the strategic goals of the business.

The 7 core values have been encapsulated by one sentence as follows:

***"We focus on the user, fostering a thriving community without compromising on excellence, taking ownership to deliver more with less, through continuous learning and innovation that shapes the future."***

The important of Tutorwise’s core values may appear to be over-emphasised, they serve as the strategic tools that differentiate Tutorwise from its competitors, who do not possess the same principles. These values represent the very DNA of Tutorwise and should be embedded into its AI-powered solutions and prompts to automate the development and execution of the business capability. If successful, it would strengthen Tutorwise’s market position, sustain growth, and solidify its brand authority as an innovative leader in the tutoring industry.
