## Description
h3. *Post-MVP*

​These tools are incredibly valuable for scaling and maintaining a high-quality product, but they require significant setup and maintenance time that is better spent elsewhere during the MVP phase.

* ​*Storybook & Chromatic*: Building a full visual component library is a significant undertaking. For an MVP, it's often faster to build the UI directly and worry about creating a shareable, documented design system later.
* ​*SonarQube & Security Scanners*: These are for when you have a growing team and a product with real users, where the cost of a security breach or a major bug becomes much higher.
