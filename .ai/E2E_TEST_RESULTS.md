### Issue: `should match Figma design system` Test Failure (UI Bug)

**Test Case:** `tests/e2e/account/professional-info.spec.ts` - `should match Figma design system`

**Problem:** The test fails with a timeout (`Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded`) while waiting for the `.formSection` element to be visible. This indicates that the form section is not rendering or is not visible on the page as expected.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**

1.  Ran the test individually.
2.  Added `page.waitForSelector('.formSection')` to explicitly wait for the element.
3.  Increased the `waitForSelector` timeout to 60 seconds, but the test still timed out at 30 seconds, suggesting a global test timeout might be overriding.

**Conclusion:** The test failure is due to a UI bug in the application where the `.formSection` element is not present or not visible on the `/account/professional-info` page. This prevents the test from proceeding to check design system elements.

**Resolution:** This requires a fix in the application's UI code to ensure the `.formSection` element is correctly rendered and visible on the `/account/professional-info` page. The test itself needs to be re-run after the UI fix is implemented.
