- Tracks educational goals and outcomes

**Provider (Tutor):**
- Manages teaching services and availability
- Handles student communications and sessions
- Tracks earnings from tutoring services

  profile: Profile | null;
  user: User | null;
  activeRole: 'agent' | 'seeker' | 'provider';
  availableRoles: ('agent' | 'seeker' | 'provider')[];
  switchRole: (role: 'agent' | 'seeker' | 'provider') => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
}
```

**Role-Based Routing:**
```typescript
// Route structure
/dashboard/student     // Student dashboard
/dashboard/tutor      // Tutor dashboard
/dashboard/agent      // Agent dashboard
/dashboard            // Default role dashboard
```

#### **Dynamic Dashboard Component**

**Adaptive Dashboard Logic:**
```typescript
const getDashboardConfig = (activeRole: string) => {
  switch (activeRole) {
    case 'seeker':
      return studentDashboardConfig;
    case 'provider':
      return tutorDashboardConfig;
    case 'agent':
      return agentDashboardConfig;
    default:
      return defaultDashboardConfig;
  }
};
```

**Role-Specific Styling:**
```css
.dashboard {
  --role-primary: var(--student-blue);
  --role-secondary: var(--student-blue-light);
}

.dashboard[data-role="provider"] {
  --role-primary: var(--tutor-green);
  --role-secondary: var(--tutor-green-light);
