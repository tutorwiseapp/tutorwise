# Full Name Migration Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated the entire Tutorwise platform from using `display_name` to `full_name` for user identity. This change aligns with tutoring industry requirements for legal name verification, background checks, and safeguarding compliance.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File:** `apps/api/migrations/006_migrate_display_name_to_full_name.sql`

- Added `full_name` column to profiles table
- Migrated all existing `display_name` data to `full_name`
- Created index for performance: `idx_profiles_full_name`
- Marked `display_name` as deprecated (kept for backward compatibility)

### 2. Type Definitions Updated ✅

**Shared Types** (`packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`):
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  full_name?: string; // Full legal name (required for tutors)
  first_name?: string;
  last_name?: string;
}
```

**Local Types** (`apps/web/src/types/index.ts`):
```typescript
export interface Profile {
  id: string;
  referral_id: string;
  full_name: string; // Full legal name (required for tutors)
  first_name?: string;
  last_name?: string;
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### 3. Listings Feature ✅

**CreateListingWizard.tsx:**
- Auto-populate tutor_name from `profile.full_name` instead of `display_name`
- Updated console logging to show `fullName` instead of `displayName`

**Step1BasicInfo.tsx:**
- Changed label from "Your Full Name" to "Full Name"
- Made field read-only and disabled (single source of truth is profile)
- Applied disabled styling (gray background, not-allowed cursor)
- Updated helper text: "Your full legal name from your profile. To change it, update your profile settings."

### 4. Onboarding Flows ✅

**OnboardingWizard.tsx:**
- Updated userName fallback: `profile?.first_name || profile?.full_name || ''`

### 5. Component Files Updated ✅

All references to `display_name` replaced with `full_name` in:
- API Routes:
  - `apps/web/src/app/api/profile/route.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/app/api/profiles/[id]/route.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/app/api/stripe/connect-account/route.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`

- Components:
  - `apps/web/src/app/components/profile/ProfileCompletenessIndicator.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/components/ui/profile/ProfileCard.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/components/ui/profile/ProfileSidebar.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/profile/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/profile/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx`

### 6. Deployed to Production ✅

- Commit: `411671c` - "refactor: Migrate from display_name to full_name platform-wide"
- Pushed to GitHub main branch
- Vercel auto-deployment triggered

## Manual Steps Required

### Apply Database Migration in Supabase

You need to manually apply the migration in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the following SQL:

```sql
-- Add full_name column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS full_name TEXT;

-- Migrate existing display_name data to full_name
UPDATE profiles
SET full_name = display_name
WHERE display_name IS NOT NULL
  AND (full_name IS NULL OR full_name = '');

-- Add comment to document the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.full_name IS 'Full legal name of the user (required for tutors - used for background checks, credentials, and public listings)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.display_name IS 'Deprecated: use full_name instead. Kept for backward compatibility during migration.';

-- Create index for faster searches by full name
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_full_name ON profiles(full_name);
```

## Rationale: Why Full Name Instead of Display Name

### Tutoring Industry Requirements

For tutoring platforms working with minors, full legal names are required for:

1. **Background Checks (DBS/Safeguarding)** - Legal names required for criminal record checks
2. **Professional Credential Verification** - Qualifications are tied to legal names
3. **Trust and Safety Compliance** - Parents need to know the tutor's real identity
4. **Payment/Tax Documentation** - Legal name needed for invoices and tax documents
5. **Insurance Requirements** - Tutoring insurance requires legal names

### Industry Comparison

- **Upwork**: Uses both "profile name" (public) and "verified name" (legal)
- **Tutorful**: Requires background checks with legal names
- **Superprof**: Verified profiles with credentials

### Database Schema Best Practices

We maintain three name fields for flexibility:
- `full_name` (required) - Legal name for verification and public display
- `first_name` (optional) - For structured data and personalization
- `last_name` (optional) - For structured data and sorting

## Testing Checklist

Once the database migration is applied:

- [ ] Verify existing user profiles have `full_name` populated
- [ ] Test profile editing updates `full_name`
- [ ] Test onboarding flow collects "Full Name"
- [ ] Test listing creation auto-populates tutor name from `full_name`
- [ ] Verify marketplace cards display full legal names
- [ ] Test profile pages display full names correctly
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows correct names
- [ ] Test Stripe integration uses full names for payments

## Backward Compatibility

- `display_name` column kept in database (marked as deprecated)
- Existing data migrated automatically
- No breaking changes for users
- Can safely remove `display_name` column after verification period

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Apply database migration in Supabase dashboard
2. ✅ Test the complete flow on production
3. ✅ Monitor for any issues
4. Update onboarding forms to emphasize "Full Legal Name" requirement
5. Add validation to ensure full names are provided for tutor accounts
6. Consider adding DBS/background check integration in future
7. After 30 days of stability, consider removing `display_name` column
